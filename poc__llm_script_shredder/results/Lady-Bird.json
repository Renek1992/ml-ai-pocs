    "script_context": "                 LADY BIRD            written by Greta Gerwig   ii.                            Anybody who talks about California hedonism has never spent a Christmas in Sacramento. - Joan Didion   INT. MOTEL. CALIFORNIA. EARLY MORNING.  One of those anonymous trucker motels along-side I-5 through central California. It\u2019s late summer, 2002. Two women sleep together in a bed. Christine, aka Lady Bird, 17 years old. Her Mom, Marion, the age of Lady Bird\u2019s Mom. A modern-day romantic Mary Cassatt rip-off painting of motherhood.  LADY BIRD (V.O.) Do you think I look like I\u2019m from Sacramento? CUT TO:  Now they\u2019re awake. Lady Bird stares at her re. Marion makes the bed. MARION You are from Sacramento. LADY BIRD (re: making the bed) You don\u2019t have to do that. MARION Well it\u2019s nice to make things neat and clean.  Marion is making hospital corners. Lady Bird sits on the just made bed. Marion sits beside her, moves the hair out of Lady Bird\u2019s eyes. MARION (CONT\u2019D) Ready to go home? LADY BIRD Ready. INT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. CALIFORNIA. DAY. The last sentences of The Grapes of Wrath. AUDIOBOOK \u201cHer hand moved behind his head and supported it. Her fingers moved gently in his hair. She looked up and across the barn, and her lips came together and smiled mysteriously.\u201d You have been listening to \u2018The Grapes of Wrath\u2019 by John Steinbeck. If you... (pause)  2.    Lady Bird ejects the tape, returns it to the case from the public library. They are both crying. LADY BIRD (looking on the back) Our college trip took 21 hours and 5 minutes.  They laugh and then wipe their tears. It\u2019s a nice moment - they both had the same emotion. Lady Bird immediately starts looking for a good song on the radio. MARION (turning it off) Hey, you know, let\u2019s just sit with what we heard? LADY BIRD (bristling) Are you serious? MARION We don\u2019t need to be constantly entertaining ourselves, do we? Lady Bird stares out the window, now sullen. Then: LADY BIRD I wish I could live through something.  MARION Aren\u2019t you? LADY BIRD Nope. The only exciting thing about 2002 is that it\u2019s a palindrome.  MARION Ok fine, yours is the worst life of all, you win.   LADY BIRD Oh so now you\u2019re mad? Because I wanted to listen to music? MARION It\u2019s just that you\u2019re being ridiculous, you have a great life. LADY BIRD I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not perfect. MARION Nobody is asking you to be perfect! Just considerate would do. 3.    LADY BIRD (really picking a fight) I don\u2019t even want to go to school in this state anyway, I hate California. I want to go to the East Coast. MARION Your Dad and I will barely be able to afford in-state tuition. LADY BIRD There are loans, scholarships! MARION Your brother, your very smart brother, can\u2019t even find a job -- LADY BIRD He and Shelly work. They have jobs. MARION THEY BAG AT THE GROCERY STORE. That is not a career and they went to BERKELEY.MARION Your father\u2019s company is laying people off right and left, did you know that? No of course not because you don\u2019t care about anyone but yourself. MARION Immaculate Heart is already a luxury.  LADY BIRD Immaculate FART. You wanted that, not me!  MARION Miguel saw someone knifed in front of him at Sac High, is that what you want? You\u2019re telling me that you want to see someone knifed right in front of you? 4.    LADY BIRD He barely saw that. I want to go where culture is, like New York.   MARION How in the world did I raise such a SNOB?  MARION  LADY BIRD Or at least Connecticut or New Hampshire. Where writers live in the woods. You couldn\u2019t get into those schools anyway.   MOM! LADY BIRD  MARION You can\u2019t even pass your driver\u2019s test.  LADY BIRD Because you wouldn\u2019t let me practice enough! MARION The way you work, the way you don\u2019t work, you\u2019re not even worth state tuition, Christine.  LADY BIRD MY NAME IS LADY BIRD!   LADY BIRD MARION (CONT'D) Well actually, it\u2019s not, and it\u2019s ridiculous. Your name is Christine. CALL ME LADY BIRD LIKE YOU SAID YOU WOULD!  MARION You should just go to City College, with your work ethic. City College and then to jail then back to City College. Maybe you\u2019d learn how to pull yourself up and not expect everyone to do everything for you...  They slow for a stop light and Lady Bird dramatically opens the door and rolls out of the car. Marion screams. 5.    INT. IMMACULATE HEART OF MARY. DAY.  Close on a cast. In very small letters is written \u201cfuck you, mom.\u201d The cast belongs to Lady Bird. She follows along with the mass.  CREDITS run over this joint liturgy between Immaculate Heart of Mary (girls school) and Xavier (boys school) and beginning of the year activities.  A sea of catholic girls\u2019 school uniforms in bleachers during candidate speeches.  CANDIDATE (finishing her speech) A Vote for Amanda is a vote for boys. Boys and healthy vending machines because no one wants a muffin with that many calories.  Lady Bird waits her turn to make her speech, and makes eye contact with Julie in the crowd, a sweet, chubby 17 year old. Her best friend.   5 classrooms, 5 syllabi, 5 \u201cbeginning of senior year\u201d speeches from the teachers. A few teachers are nuns. SISTER SARAH-JOAN There are the classics: St. Augustine, of course, and Aquinas. My favorite, Kierkegaard - wait until you hear his love story - it will make you swoon. Back in the church, Lady Bird looks intently at an image of Jesus. The priest gives his homily. PRIEST We\u2019re afraid we won\u2019t get into the college of our choice, we\u2019re afraid we won\u2019t be loved, we won\u2019t be liked, we won\u2019t succeed.  Everyone takes communion. Lady Bird approaches and crosses her arms so she just gets a blessing, not real communion, she\u2019s not Catholic. Lady Bird watches the boys get communion. It\u2019s somehow sexy, opening their mouths to receive the wafer. SISTER SARAH-JOAN (V.O.) Some of the students were disturbed by your posters. 6.    INT. VICE-PRINCIPAL SISTER SARAH-JOAN\u2019S OFFICE. DAY.  Sister Sarah-Joan, in a traditional habit, holds up some of Lady Bird\u2019s campaign materials. LADY BIRD It\u2019s just a bird head on a lady body or vice versa. SISTER SARAH-JOAN I think it\u2019s a little upsetting...  Reveal of the poster: Lady Bird\u2019s head on a bird body. Another shows her Catholic-uniformed body with a bird head. LADY BIRD It\u2019s my tradition to run for office. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t win. SISTER SARAH-JOAN That\u2019s not what I\u2019m worried about. LADY BIRD (worried) This won\u2019t mess with my scholarship, will it? SISTER SARAH-JOAN No, you\u2019re okay there. (trying to be helpful) You have a performative streak, I think.  LADY BIRD I think that too. SISTER SARAH-JOAN Maybe you\u2019d enjoy theatre arts... They are having auditions for the fall musical. LADY BIRD Do we have that here? SISTER SARAH-JOAN It\u2019s a collaborative effort with the men at Xavier. LADY BIRD How am I a senior and not know we have that? 7.    SISTER SARAH-JOAN Perhaps you haven\u2019t always been an active part of this community. SISTER SARAH-JOAN They do a fall musical and a spring play and from what I hear it\u2019s a real blast. LADY BIRD What I\u2019d really like is to be on Math Olympiad. SISTER SARAH-JOAN (gently) But math isn\u2019t something that you are terribly strong in? LADY BIRD That we know of YET. CLOSE ON A LIST.  Sign ups for auditions for the fall musical. A hand reaches up and takes the pen attached and writes, in all caps: CHRISTINE \u201cLADY BIRD\u201d McPHERSON And then another hand reaches up and writes: JULIANNE \u201cJULIE\u201d PICKETT LADY BIRD (O.S.) \u201cJulie\u201d doesn\u2019t need to be in quotes.  JULIE (O.S.) But it\u2019s not my real name. Reveal Julie and Lady Bird debating this: LADY BIRD It\u2019s not the same thing.  JULIE (shaking her head) I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re right... 8.    EXT. SACRAMENTO STREETS. LATE AFTERNOON.  Julie and Lady Bird walk through the \u201cfancy\u201d neighborhood, \u201cThe Fabulous Forties.\u201d They stop in front of this very specific house - it is the Dream House: It is three stories and blue, with white shutters and a big American Flag. It looks like nothing bad would ever happen in this house. JULIE I love this neighborhood. LADY BIRD Yeah, it\u2019s so beautiful. JULIE If I lived here I would definitely have my wedding in the backyard. LADY BIRD I\u2019d have friends over all the time to study and eat snacks. I\u2019d be like \u201cMOM WE\u2019RE TAKING THE SNACKS UPSTAIRS TO THE TV ROOM.\u201d JULIE I\u2019d have my own bathroom. INT. GROCERY STORE. EARLY EVENING.  Julie and Lady Bird browse magazines in an empty checkout aisle. A Checker calls out to them: CHECKER I can\u2019t stop you dicks from hanging out here but quit wrinkling all the magazines!  LADY BIRD When I\u2019m in this store, I\u2019m not your sister - I\u2019m a customer, Miguel! I\u2019m always right!  This is Miguel. Lady Bird\u2019s brother. 22, Latino, clearly adopted. Julie watches him and his girlfriend, Shelly Yuhan, 22, a Bagger:  JULIE Ever since she moved in, your brother and Shelly are becoming the same person. LADY BIRD No way. 9.    Shelly and Miguel have the same asymmetrical hair-cut and \u201cinteresting\u201d piercings. Vaguely punk looking. Seem like they\u2019re wearing black leather jackets even when they aren\u2019t. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Yeah, okay, maybe. JULIE (re: magazine) See, why I don\u2019t look like that?  The girls look at a model in the magazine. She poses in front of the New York City skyline. LADY BIRD Just once I\u2019d like to have the song \u201cNew York Groove\u201d play and feel like it really applies to my life. JULIE You\u2019ve never even been to New York. LADY BIRD That\u2019s why I\u2019m applying to New York colleges - do you know if Sarah Lawrence is actually IN the city? JULIE Your parents would pay for that? LADY BIRD Scholarships, financial aid. I\u2019ll figure it out. My Mom thinks I can\u2019t get in but she is sorely mistaken.  JULIE What about terrorism? LADY BIRD Don\u2019t be a Republican. JULIE I\u2019m probably just going to go to City College. MIGUEL (almost yelling)  PUT THE MAGAZINE BACK.SHIT. INT. PSYCH HOSPITAL. EARLY MORNING. Marion yawns. Luis, a large Filipino man, approaches her: 10.    LUIS You doing okay, mama? MARION Yes, but that was terrifying wasn\u2019t it? Thank god you were there. I guess I can\u2019t have pencils anymore.  LUIS Yeah, gotta go back to just felt tip markers. Crayola.  Marion suddenly remembers she has something, she hand Luis a small bag:  MARION Oh Luis this is for you! I got it for the baby, I couldn\u2019t resist it.  He pulls out a frilly pink dress for a toddler. LUIS She loves pink! MARION Well, it\u2019s really more for you and Andrea than it is for the baby, and I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t have time to wrap it.... LUIS No, it\u2019s perfect. MARION See you tomorrow... I mean, later? Luis just laughs. INT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. EARLY MORNING.  Marion drives back home. It is romantic somehow. She loves these streets, loves the turns she knows so well. When she\u2019s not resenting the stuck-ness of her own life she has an enormous capacity to love it. Remember this moment with Marion. EXT. LADY BIRD\u2019S NEIGHBORHOOD. EARLY MORNING.  Marion drives up. Women are watering their lawns, getting the paper, doing yard work, touching their flowers. Solidly middle class. Marion waves to neighbors. They wave back. She picks up the mail, bills, papers, etc. 11.    INT. BATHROOM. MORNING.  Dad (50s, name: Larry) brushes his teeth. Marion perched on the edge of the tub with a newspaper and a stack of mail, going through it.  LARRY Did you know toothpaste is basically ineffective? It\u2019s like sucking on a mint. MARION (to Larry, shaking her head) Mike Kerry died. I didn\u2019t know he was sick again. LARRY How old was he? MARION Only fifty-six. Knocking at the door. MIGUEL (O.S.) Can Shelly and I get in there? MARION In a minute honey Dad and I are still in here! LARRY (re: Mike) That\u2019s too young. MARION (calling) LADY BIRD YOU BETTER BE DRESSED!  LADY BIRD I AM DRESSED.  MARION (CONT\u2019D) I\u2019ll send them a note. (a little softer) Do you think that Shelly and Miguel have sex on the pullout couch? 12.    LARRY Oh yeah.  Marion laughs at Larry\u2019s subtle joke. He laughs at her laughter. They like each other. INT. KITCHEN. MORNING.  Miguel and Shelly eat cereal. Larry reads the paper. Marion makes Lady Bird\u2019s breakfast and her lunch. LADY BIRD Why can\u2019t I just make the eggs? MARION Because you take too long and make a big mess and then I have to clean it up. SHELLY (small voice) Eggs aren\u2019t good for the environment, anyway. LADY BIRD (too loud) WHAT?  MIGUEL You heard her. MARION (placing the eggs) Here, eat quickly, PLEASE. LARRY (re: paper) Look at all these pictures. Every newspaper looks like USA Today.  MIGUEL Shelly and I are trying to be vegan. Hence the soy milk. LADY BIRD You wear leather jackets. 13.    SHELLY They\u2019re vintage. It doesn\u2019t support the industry. LADY BIRD (poking at the eggs) They aren\u2019t done, there\u2019s white stuff.  SHELLY You know how you love Brambles? Pigs are smarter than him even. LADY BIRD I never thought Brambles was a GENIUS okay?   LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) (very obnoxious) MOM! The eggs are NOT DONE! MARION FINE MAKE YOUR OWN FUCKING EGGS.  Marion then throws the frying pan violently in the sink and retreats to the bathroom. The noisy hair-dryer starts up. LADY BIRD I WANTED TO YOU WON\u2019T LET ME! Lady Bird follows Marion out of the room. SHELLY Your sister doesn\u2019t like me. LADY BIRD (O.S.)  MOM!!! I\u2019M HUNGRY!   MIGUEL She does.  Shelly gets up, pouting. MIGUEL follows her   MARION (O.S.) YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE! GOING TO BED! 14.   Larry is left alone. It\u2019s weirdly peaceful for half a second. INT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. DAY. Lady Bird and Larry on the way to school. She feverishly changes the radio station, finds a song she likes: LADY BIRD Did you know that Alanis Morisette wrote this song in only ten minutes?  LARRY I believe it. LADY BIRD (she smiles) So I\u2019m applying to a couple East Coast schools. I need you to help me with the financial aid application but Mom can\u2019t know. LARRY We... aren\u2019t they quite expensive?  LADY BIRD First, yes that\u2019s why financial aid. Second, I have to get in first.  LARRY Mom won\u2019t be happy about it. LADY BIRD Which is why I don\u2019t want to fight about it before I have to. 15.    Lady Bird looks up. They are a couple of blocks from school. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Just pull over here LARRY Are you sure, I can drive you to the front -- LADY BIRD No, just this is fine. I like to walk.  LARRY Okay, well, I love you. LADY BIRD So what do you think? About college?  LARRY I\u2019ll see what I can do. LADY BIRD (kisses him on the cheek) Thanks Dad, love you too. Have a good day at work. LARRY Hey, I\u2019m like Keith Richards \u201cI\u2019m just happy to be anywhere.\u201d  She gets out quickly and hurries away. She\u2019s almost at school when Julie pulls up.  JULIE (calling out) Hey bitch!   Ms. Pickett has VERY LARGE fake breasts. Her boyfriend, Matt, hands a sack lunch to Lady Bird and Julie. MATT Alright girls, hope you like pickles. 16.    JULIE Thanks, Uncle Matt. LADY BIRD Sweet! Ms. Pickett gets in the driver\u2019s seat, they drive away. LADY BIRD He\u2019s not your uncle. JULIE It\u2019s something I\u2019m trying out. Bye, mom.   (watching Ms. Pickett go) Your Mom really likes you. JULIE Yeah. I just keep getting fatter.   Lady Bird starts eating the Matt lunch and chucks her own lunch into a garbage can. The one her Mom spent time making. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) (mouth full) Me too. Matt is awesome.  JULIE Yeah, I hope he marries my Mom. That would be nice. He promised me his old car when I turn eighteen.  In the student parking lot, a girl gets out of her fancy Range Rover. She\u2019s pretty in a high school way. LADY BIRD That car should be illegal. Jenna Walton\u2019s not doing any off-roading. She just goes to Pavillions. JULIE I heard Jenna Walton has a tanning bed in her house.  The girl, Jenna Walton, is very tan. Identical tan girls descend on her.  LADY BIRD She is so pretty.  JULIE Her skin is luminous.   LADY BIRD Maybe we should try tanning. 17.    INT. VESTMENT ROOM. DAY  Lady Bird and Julie sit with their legs up the wall, eating communion wafers out of a large plastic container. LADY BIRD Yeah, in the tub I just scoot myself under like now, like this, and then the water just...  She gestures, showing that the water would flow into her crotch and get her off. They are hysterically laughing. JULIE We are so gross! LADY BIRD I think I figured it out when I was like three or something. JULIE I use, I take off the shower head, oh god this is so embarrassing! I use that.  LADY BIRD I don\u2019t know if mine is the right kind, though. Maybe it\u2019s different when you actually have a penis in there, like it\u2019s more intense. JULIE Mine is pretty intense, I think. Darlene, an odd looking girl, has silently walked in. DARLENE You\u2019re not supposed to eat the wafers!  JULIE (trying to be helpful) They aren\u2019t consecrated.  Darlene turns on her heel, annoyed. Lady Bird and Julie dissolve into giggles. INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. DAY.  Lady Bird, wearing an extreme \u201caudition\u201d dress, and Julie, in her uniform, sit and watch other students perform. 18.    Father Leviatch runs auditions - there is something funny and depressed about him. An overweight woman, Miss Patty, accompanies on the piano when needed. A boy, Greg, is up. He has a big voice for such a tiny boy: GREG \u201cBEING ALIVVEEEEEEEEEE......!\u201d Cut to Father Leviatch calling out from his clipboard: FATHER LEVIATCH Okay, Christine? LADY BIRD Lady Bird. FATHER LEVIATCH Is that your given name? LADY BIRD Yes. FATHER LEVIATCH Why is it in quotes? LADY BIRD Well I gave it to myself. It\u2019s given. To me, by me. FATHER LEVIATCH OK, take it away, Lady Bird. Cut to Lady Bird singing her song. LADY BIRD \u201cEverybody says don\u2019t / Everybody says don\u2019t / Everybody says don\u2019t it isn\u2019t right, don\u2019t it isn\u2019t niiiiiceeee / Everybody says don\u2019t / Everybody says don\u2019t / Everybody says don\u2019t walk on the grass....\u201d Cut to Julie, wearing her uniform, shy and nervous: JULIE (singing) \u201cMake me a channel of your peace / where there\u2019s despair in life let me bring hope / where there is darkness only light / and where there\u2019s sadness ever joy....\u201d  Julie has a sweet, clear, beautiful voice. It\u2019s a quiet moment and everyone pays attention. 19.    More girls and more boys. Now most everyone is done.  Danny stands. He\u2019s very handsome. Strapping, even. He gives his sheet music to the Miss Patty. Then he sings: DANNY (singing) \u201cThere are giants in the sky! / There are big tall terrible giants in the sky! When you\u2019re way up high and you look below at the world you\u2019ve left and the things you know little than a glance is enough to show you just how small you are!\u201d  He\u2019s AMAZING. Julie and Lady Bird look at each other. DREAM BOAT CITY. INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S ROOM. NIGHT.  Underneath her window sill by her bed, Lady Bird writes the name: DANNY.  She\u2019s in love and want to make it permanent somewhere. Suddenly, a voice is directed right at Lady Bird\u2019s door: MARION (O.S.) I CAN SEE THE LIGHT ON IN YOUR ROOM GO TO BED! Lady Bird shuts off her light and sleeps, dreaming of Danny. EXT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. DAY Lady Bird and Julie check the casting list. They first find: MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG Franklin Shepard: Danny O\u2019Neill, Charlie Kringus: Greg Anrue Gussie: Diana Greenway, Beth: Julie Steffans. They move way down the list until they find: Swing/Chorus: Christine McPherson LADY BIRD (tightly) Congratulations. JULIE You too! We both got in! 20.    LADY BIRD Everyone who auditioned got in. The part I got was basically not getting in. JULIE (trying to downplay) I do not even know how I got cast in my part. LADY BIRD Me neither. I was the one who had a dress and prepared a song. JULIE I know! LADY BIRD (thinking) Now you\u2019re going to get romantic with Danny on stage. JULIE It\u2019s probably my only shot at that, you know? LADY BIRD  She take the pen and crosses out Christine and writes LADY BIRD. Leaves.  Julie stays and when she\u2019s sure she\u2019s alone she touches her name - loving herself and the feeling of being chosen. INT. GROCERY STORE. EARLY EVENING. Marion grocery shops. Lady Bird looks at a BRIDE magazine. LADY BIRD Mom... MARION (re: the magazine) We don\u2019t need to buy that. LADY BIRD It\u2019s only three dollars. I\u2019m having a hard week. MARION If you want to read it we can go to the public library. LADY BIRD I want to read it in bed. 21.   MARION That\u2019s something rich people do. We are not rich people.  Lady Bird walks away and then tucks the magazine underneath her sweater into the top of her skirt, sneakily stealing it.  As she\u2019s performing this maneuver, she sees DANNY (!) and his Mom and three little brothers walk by. She walks up bravely: LADY BIRD Hey! DANNY Hi. LADY BIRD Come here often? DANNY (not getting the joke) Excuse me?  LADY BIRD (extending her hand) I\u2019m Lady Bird, we\u2019re going to be in the musical together. DANNY Oh, yeah, I remember you! You were wearing that dress. LADY BIRD I just wanted to say what\u2019s up and I\u2019ll see you in rehearsal. DANNY Thanks, I\u2019m super excited. You live in the neighborhood? LADY BIRD (doing a voice) Nah, I\u2019m from the wrong side of the tracks.  DANNY What?  LADY BIRD Is that your family? There are so many of you! DANNY Irish-Catholic! It\u2019s hard to find a girl to date that\u2019s not my cousin. 22.    LADY BIRD (flustered) Well, okay. You\u2019re going to make a great Franklin. DANNY Thanks! I want my hair, his hair to be curly, though.   Yeah! LADY BIRD  DANNY Like Jim Morrison. Very \u201970s. LADY BIRD Like Jim Morrison exactly. DANNY\u2019S MOM DANNY!  Gotta go!  DANNY  Lady Bird walks back to Marion, who is with Miguel while he scans their groceries and Shelly bags them. LADY BIRD Who is Jim Morrison again? MIGUEL He was in a rock band, moron, The Doors.  LADY BIRD I knew that. MARION (looking at the bill) This is with your employee discount?  MIGUEL Yeah, it\u2019s already included. Marion looks worried. INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. AFTERNOON.  Everyone tries to keep up with the dance steps Miss Patty teaches them. She is also, apparently, the choreographer. She can move amazingly well for a bigger woman. 23.    They play theatre games and do acting exercises. Father Leviatch is actually quite good at casting a spell and making everyone feel included.  CUT TO:  The priest, Father Leviatch, looks around the stage where everyone sits, cross legged, tired from dancing. FATHER LEVIATCH To get our emotions going, we\u2019re going to play \u201cfirst one to cry wins.\u201d  FATHER LEVIATCH Starting ... Now. I\u2019m playing too. So is Miss Patty. Miss Patty nods.  They all try to cry really hard. Suddenly everyone looks up - Father Leviatch is sobbing. Everyone is uncomfortable watching an adult man cry.  FATHER LEVIATCH I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. EXT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. AFTERNOON. Diana, another girl in the play, dishes the gossip while she and Lady Bird and Danny wait for their rides: DIANA I heard that before he became a priest he was married and he had a son named Etienne who died of a drug overdose at 17 which was maybe a suicide but my mom says same difference if you are so careless with your life. (a horn honks) Oh that\u2019s her! Gotta go, bye guys!  Lady Bird and Danny wave goodbye and then fall into a semi- awkward silence. She sees it\u2019s her Moment. She tries to casually hand Danny a bag but it\u2019s a kind of big bag. 24.    LADY BIRD Oh, I almost forgot. I brought you these hot rollers. For your Jim Morrison hair. He pulls out the Conair pink and purple \u201cHot Sticks.\u201d DANNY Thank you so much.  LADY BIRD You\u2019re welcome.  DANNY You\u2019ll have to show me how to use them. LADY BIRD (weirdly formal) It would be my pleasure. DANNY They look like sperms.  He laughs and Lady Bird joins in. They do look like sperms but it wasn\u2019t so funny to say it. DANNY (CONT\u2019D) Hey! I just remembered I had a dream about you! LADY BIRD Really?! What happened? DANNY We were flying to Disneyland on a giant carrot.... LADY BIRD Awesome! DANNY I love Disneyland. LADY BIRD Me too, I think it\u2019s kind of scary but I also love it. Triumph! They are having a Real Conversation. INT. ALGEBRA II CLASS. DAY Mr. Bruno explains a problem on a projector. He\u2019s handsome and young-ish. Definitely handsome for an all girls school. Lady Bird zones out, thinking about Danny. Julie looks intently at Mr. Bruno. She loves him, privately. 25.    MR. BRUNO (finishing an explanation) Don\u2019t leave me hanging. Can I get a nod? That\u2019s good. Maybe even a verbal confirmation? JULIE (too loud) YES.  Julie experience her mini moment of private embarrassment. They are handed back quizzes. Julie gets a A-. MR. BRUNO Good job, Jules, I could tell from your work that you even understood the one you missed! He kind of winks at her. She blushes. LADY BIRD (looking at her grade) SUCK A DICK. JULIE (to Lady Bird) I like \u201cJules.\u201d Lady Bird looks at her C+. LADY BIRD I just don\u2019t get why I\u2019m not good at math, my Dad is really good at math. Even Miguel has a math degree.  JULIE Maybe it\u2019s your Mom\u2019s fault. INT. HOMECOMING DANCE. SCHOOL GYM. NIGHT.  There are a bunch of kids clumped, some dancing, some sitting on half-hearted hay bales. The popular girls, Jenna etc., wear tank tops that say (front) Ditch the horse... (and back) Ride the cowboy!  Lady Bird and Julie now have on bandanas and denim - they\u2019re doing the Groucho Marx Duck Soup dance to \u201cTha Crossroads.\u201d Suddenly Lady Bird stops. JULIE You lose! POINT JULIE! LADY BIRD No, look26.  Across the dance, there is Danny. He\u2019s wearing chaps, a holster, a hat, fake pistols. Like teenage John Wayne. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Wish me luck. JULIE Luck. Julie watches as Lady Bird makes a bee-line for Danny. LADY BIRD Wanna dance? DANNY Hell, yeah!  They start slow dancing together. Julie does the duck-soup dance alone and then stops. It\u2019s pointless without a buddy. She falls back and watches. Sister Sarah-Joan walks by Lady Bird and Danny: SISTER SARAH-JOAN Six inches for the Holy Spirit!  They roll their eyes: Rules! Once she leaves Danny pulls Lady Bird close again. She swoons. Life is happening. EXT. SCHOOL GYM. NIGHT.  Lady Bird, Julie and Danny wait outside of the dance, leaning against the gym waiting for their parents. Julie\u2019s Mom pulls up with Uncle Matt. Honks. JULIE (to Lady Bird) That\u2019s us!  LADY BIRD Nah, my Mom is coming. JULIE No she\u2019s not. LADY BIRD (pointed) Yes, she is. JULIE But the plan was sleepover at - LADY BIRD IT\u2019S FINE. 27.    Lady Bird is clearly trying to stay there with Danny. JULIE (annoyed) Okay, bye then.  Julie gets in the front seat to practice driving. Leaves. Lady Bird and Danny are quiet, listening to the muffled sounds of the dance. Then: DANNY Have you ever been out of the country?  LADY BIRD When I was little, my Dad had a job that took him to Brazil. I remember from the pictures. DANNY I\u2019ve never been out of the country. It\u2019s my dream to go to Paris.  LADY BIRD (sighs) Paris. DANNY That\u2019s why I\u2019m learning French. LADY BIRD My mom said French wasn\u2019t useful. DANNY It is if you want to go to Paris. They laugh.  DANNY (CONT\u2019D) I still don\u2019t know how to use those rollers you gave me. LADY BIRD Oh, it\u2019s so easy, like after they heat up, you just take your hair and twist the hair and then twirl the thing like this...  She reaches up to his hair. He kisses her. It\u2019s surprising. They kiss again. It\u2019s romantic, really romantic. EXT. SACRAMENTO STREETS. NIGHT.  Lady Bird walks home. She\u2019s smiling so huge and throws her face to the sky and screams. INT. HOUSE. NIGHT. 28.   Marion and Larry are arguing with a lot of financial documents strewn across the kitchen table. 29.    MARION Larry how long will this hold us. LARRY I don\u2019t know...  Lady Bird opens the back door, glowing and shiny from the night and the kiss. She sneaks past. MARION Well, someone must know. Can the whole family go on Cobra, even Miguel? What happens if someone gets in an accident? LARRY I\u2019m not sure - the severance package I think it expires all at once, not within the calendar year...  Lady Bird tip-toes into her room. She knows she wasn\u2019t supposed to see this. And she doesn\u2019t want to know any more. MARION I\u2019ll ask at my work if -- Suddenly, a noise makes her turn her head sharply. MARION (CONT\u2019D) Is she home? LARRY Maybe leave it for tonight... MARION No, she knows better. (getting up) She cannot sneak around like this... Marion barrels down the hallway towards Lady Bird\u2019s room. INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. Lady-Bird, under the covers, hears her Mom coming. Then all the lights come on, it\u2019s so bright: MARION Christine! You can\u2019t leave your room like this! LADY BIRD I didn\u2019t... 30.  MARION None of these things were put away right, they aren\u2019t nice, CHRISTINE! NOW! LADY BIRD (weakly) My name is Lady Bird.  MARION Don\u2019t lie to me, Christine!  Lady Bird sees her Dad pass by the door and give her a look like \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t help you here.\u201d He disappears. Marion picks up her uniform. MARION NO, this uniform is going to look like TRASH on Monday! MARION (CONT\u2019D) This isn\u2019t right - we can\u2019t treat our clothes like this. I don\u2019t know what your wealthy friends do... LADY BIRD Why do you care what I do to my clothes?  Marion closes the door..  MARION Your father does not have a job. MARION He lost his job, okay? Do you need him to come in here and explain that to you? 30.    MARION Of course he wouldn\u2019t do it anyway, he\u2019s Mr. Nice Guy. I always have to be the Bad Guy.  LADY BIRD Can we please talk about this tomorrow?  MARION You can\u2019t look like a rag because that makes us look like rags. And you want to know the truth? Here\u2019s the truth: some of your friends\u2019 fathers could employ your father and they won\u2019t do that if it looks like his family is trash. Lady Bird puts all her clothes away while Marion watches. LADY BIRD (quietly) Didn\u2019t you ever go to sleep without putting all your clothes away perfectly? Like even once? And don\u2019t you wish your Mom hadn\u2019t gotten angry? MARION My mother was an abusive alcoholic. Lady Bird has nothing to say to this, Marion wins. INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR\u2019S OFFICE. DAY. Lady Bird looks at some brochures. The Guidance Counselor looks at her grades and test scores. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR So I understand that you\u2019re not interested in any Catholic colleges?  LADY BIRD No way. Sorry, but yes, no way. 31.    GUIDANCE COUNSELOR Then you\u2019ll be applying to UCs and State schools? LADY BIRD Yes, but also those East Coast liberal arts schools. Like Yale, but not Yale because I probably couldn\u2019t get in. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR (laughs) You definitely couldn\u2019t get in. Part of my job is to help you be realistic.  LADY BIRD That seems like everyone\u2019s job. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR Your SAT scores are strangely very good. Lady Bird shrugs.  GUIDANCE COUNSELOR (CONT\u2019D) I\u2019d placed some calls to local alumni of the schools you\u2019re interested in, but unfortunately all the interviews are taken. LADY BIRD So... what does that mean? GUIDANCE COUNSELOR It means that you\u2019ll have to get in on how you look on paper. INT. THEATRE. DAY. The kids rehearse -- following dance moves and singing. EXT. ROSE GARDEN. NIGHT. Lady Bird and Danny lie on a blanket in the park, looking up at the stars.  DANNY Shouldn\u2019t we go home?   LADY BIRD (shakes her head) My Mom is always mad. It doesn\u2019t matter if I get home late, she\u2019d be mad at me anyway. DANNY 32.  Your Mom is hard on you. LADY BIRD (defensively) She loves me a lot. (then) Pick a star for us. DANNY  (pointing) That one, right there right next to the bright one and then the dim one - see it? LADY BIRD That\u2019s our star.  LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) (whispering) You know you can touch my boobs, right?  DANNY I know... it\u2019s just.... I respect you too much for that. LADY BIRD Oh, cool, awesome. I totally get that. Thank you. DANNY You're welcome. 33.    LADY BIRD If you had boobs I wouldn\u2019t touch them either. DANNY I respect you so much because... I love you. LADY BIRD I love you, too. They kiss and look back up at the stars. DANNY Let\u2019s name our star Claude. Lady Bird makes a face. LADY BIRD That\u2019s pretentious, don\u2019t you think?  DANNY It\u2019s French. (then) What should we name it? LADY BIRD BRUCE. They laugh and kiss and yell to the heavens.  DANNY I LOVE YOU!  LADY BIRD I LOVE YOU!  They hug and are the happiest they\u2019ve ever been, looking up at the sky and loving each other. 34.    LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) (whispers) Bruce. EXT. HALLWAYS OF IMMACULATE HEART OF MARY. DAY.  Julie and Lady Bird wander the hallways. Julie shoves a cupcake in her mouth, so does Lady Bird. The wander and chew contemplatively. LADY BIRD (not really to anyone) It\u2019s normal to not touch a penis. JULIE (looks around, notices everyone is gone) I have to go to class. LADY BIRD But I have free period! JULIE I need to pass history! LADY BIRD I think we\u2019re done with the learning portion of high school. JULIE I\u2019m gonna go.  LADY  BIRD NO! I HATE BEING ALONE!  JULIE Bye, love you. Julie takes off. Lady Bird lazily walks the halls.  She sees her empty math classroom and sees that Mr. Bruno isn\u2019t there. She ducks inside. Notices his grade binder on the desk. Snatches it and then runs. She dumps it into one of the big trash cans and hurries away. 35.    INT. THRIFT TOWN. DAY. Marion and Lady Bird are looking through dresses. MARION Did Danny say whether his grandmother has a formal Thanksgiving? LADY BIRD I don\u2019t know, there are a lot of kids, but she lives in the fab forties...  MARION (nodding) Your dad and I went to a dinner party once in that neighborhood, the CEO of ISC, and it was pretty formal. Lady Bird finds something - holds up a black dress. MARION (CONT\u2019D) You\u2019re not going to a funeral. LADY BIRD Well, I don\u2019t know! What says \u201crich people Thanksgiving\u201d? They keep looking.  MARION It\u2019s just such a shame that you\u2019re spending your last Thanksgiving with a family you\u2019ve never met instead of us, but I guess you want it that way. (clocks her walking) Are you tired? LADY BIRD No. A saleswoman, Joyce, calls out: JOYCE SALESWOMAN Hey Marion!  Marion waves to the saleswoman. Her voice is so warm and friendly with other people who are not her daughter: MARION Hey Joyce! How\u2019s the baby!  36.   JOYCE SALESWOMAN He\u2019s crawling! MARION Ooohhh, I want to see a picture at checkout! (back to Lady Bird) If you\u2019re tired we can sit down. LADY BIRD I\u2019m not tired! MARION Oh it\u2019s just that I couldn\u2019t tell because you\u2019re dragging your feet. LADY BIRD (silence) MARION Well, I just couldn\u2019t tell. LADY BIRD Why didn\u2019t you just say \u201cPick up your feet.\u201d MARION I didn\u2019t know if you were tired. LADY BIRD You were being passive aggressive! MARION No. I wasn\u2019t. LADY BIRD You are so INFURIATING. MARION Please stop yelling. LADY BIRD I\u2019m not yelling.  Marion sees something. Holds it up. It\u2019s a beautiful old fashioned looking dress. Marion has found the needle in the haystack.  LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Oh it\u2019s perfect!  MARION Don\u2019t you love it.  37.    INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S HOUSE. LATE AT NIGHT.  Marion, still in her nurses uniform, sits at the sewing machine, tailoring the dress she and Lady Bird found. She finishes, and then hangs it up quietly in Lady Bird\u2019s room. Doesn\u2019t wake her up, simply watches her daughter sleep for a minute. INT. ALGEBRA II CLASS. DAY. Mr. Bruno addresses his class: MR. Bruno So because my gradebook has disappeared, I am going to count on you to reconstruct it. I know you all know your grades better than anybody. I have a general idea, but this is all about the honor code right now, okay?  They are going up one by one to talk through their grade and he can start again.  JULIE A- MR. Bruno I\u2019m pretty sure it was an A. JULIE Um, I\u2019m not but okay... MR. Bruno It was \u2013 trust me, I know talent when I see it.  JULIE You\u2019re welcome. No, thank you.  He does that wink thing at her again. She retreats, red faced. Lady Bird is next: LADY BIRD Hey, I think B. MR. Bruno I thought it was more like B- maybe even C+ territory. LADY BIRD No, because I did really well on the last quiz... 38.    MR. Bruno I seem to remember you doing only slightly better.  LADY BIRD It brought my average up to a B. MR. Bruno Okay, B it is. It\u2019s your honor. INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S HOUSE. DAY.  Marion, Larry, Shelly and Miguel run around making sure the house is perfect for their Thanksgiving. The doorbell rings. MIGUEL LADY BIRD! YOUR LOVER AWAITS! Marion opens the door, lets in Danny. MARION Hello, Danny! The famous Danny! Aren\u2019t you adorable! (she  hugs  him) Larry isn\u2019t he adorable? LARRY He\u2019s adorable. MARION And you\u2019re driving her and everything - Wow! DANNY Thank you for letting Lady Bird come to my Grandmother\u2019s Thanksgiving, Mrs. McPherson. MARION No more politeness, just call me Marion!  DANNY (firmly shaking Larry\u2019s hand) Nice to meet you, Mr. McPherson. LARRY Please, call me Mr. Larry McPherson.39.    MARION (hits him)  Larry! Sit down Danny, can I get you something to drink?    DANNY Oh no, I\u2019m fine.   MIGUEL (waving) Hi, I\u2019m Miguel. The brother. I think Lady Bird wants to make an entrance. She\u2019s mad we don\u2019t have a spiral staircase. SHELLY (quietly) Shelly.   What? DANNY  SHELLY Is my name. They\u2019re quiet for a moment. Danny tries to converse: DANNY It\u2019s funny, on my way here, I went over the train tracks -- MARION You took H street? DANNY Right, and so just Lady Bird always says that she lives on the wrong side of the tracks, but I always thought that it was, like, a metaphor.   Ah. MARION  DANNY But there are actual train tracks. Marion\u2019s face contorts. This is painful.  Just then, Lady Bird enters, looking beautiful in her vintage dress. She holds a duffel bag. MARION (now upset with her) What in the hell is in that duffel bag? 40.    LADY BIRD Don\u2019t worry about it, Jeez! DANNY My grandmother will love that dress. INT. DANNY\u2019S GRANDMOTHER\u2019S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON.  Thanksgiving. It is at the Dream House. From the beginning. The blue one with the white trim and the American Flag. Lady Bird cannot believe it.  LADY BIRD Wait, this is your grandma\u2019s house? Oh my god.   She meets his Grandmother, almost kisses her hand like she\u2019s a queen but pulls back just in time: LADY BIRD Your house is my favorite in all of East Sacramento.    Lady Bird and Danny walk through the house. She spots very prominent Ronald Regan poster: LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Is this... a joke? DANNY No.  Lady Bird meets people, so many people, and in a lull, folds a napkin in a cool way - it looks like a four-pointed flower. Danny\u2019s Grandmother notices, and IS TOTALLY INTO IT. Soon, Lady Bird is folding all the napkins at the tables this way, teaches her how to do it, too. It is clear how much Danny\u2019s Grandmother enjoys Lady Bird. INT. DANNY\u2019S CAR. NIGHT  Lady Bird and Danny are singing along with songs from the show. Pick up Julie from her apartment complex. Pick up Greg from his house. Now they\u2019re all singing.  In the car, they change out of their Thanksgiving \u201cfinery\u201d and put on what they consider to be \u201cpeople who listen to music in coffee shop\u201d outfits. That was what the duffel was for, the costume change. There are scarves and a beret. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. NIGHT.  In their new outfits, Greg and Danny and Julie and Lady Bird smoke a out of a bowl, which another one of them lights. 41.  LADY BIRD How do you know when it\u2019s working? 42.    DANNY You\u2019ll know. LADY BIRD It\u2019s not working. GREG It\u2019s not? My sister said this was premium.  JULIE I\u2019m working. DANNY I\u2019m working too. LADY BIRD Nope. They are quiet for a second. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) I can\u2019t feel my arms. GREG You\u2019re working. They laugh really hard. Danny makes out with Lady Bird.  INT. NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. NIGHT.  They hazily take stock of everything. There are some ironic turkeys pinned up on the stage. The \u201ccool kids\u201d are there. They don\u2019t say hi but they don\u2019t shun them. Jenna Walton is there with her boyfriend, Jonah Ruiz. He\u2019s singing pretty terrible songs about her with his band, the pretentiously named L\u2019enfance Nue. LADY BIRD (whispered to Julie) If Danny and I get married and then his Grandma died, I\u2019d inherit the Dream House. JULIE Wouldn\u2019t his parent\u2019s get it? LADY BIRD (realizing) Oh yeah, we\u2019d have to kill them. And kill his older brothers, too. 43.    Kyle Scheible, a long-haired beautiful bassist, is really into it. Lady Bird spends an extra-long time looking at this Kyle Scheible. She feels DEEPLY ATTRACTED to him. She looks at Danny, she loves him, yes, but there is something else going on with Kyle Scheible. She\u2019s not sure, maybe it\u2019s the pot. Maybe not. REMEMBER KYLE, Lady Bird will.  Meanwhile, Mr. Bruno is there - weird. He looks at Julie, who was looking at him. She turns quickly away. JULIE (to no one) Where is Mr. Bruno\u2019s wife...? INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S HOUSE. NIGHT.  Lady Bird and Danny stand by the microwave, making \u201cSmart Ones\u201d frozen dinners. Six of them. Greg and Julie also eat, everyone with their own spoon taking bites out of the different platters.  Then Marion walks in - they are still giggling, she awkwardly announces herself:  MARION How\u2019s it going?  No one can say anything, it\u2019s almost like they\u2019re frozen. Finally Lady Bird is able to squeak out: LADY BIRD Mom, we really can\u2019t talk right now. They all dissolve into giggles again. MARION Well, Happy Thanksgiving. We missed you, Lady Bird. Marion leaves. She\u2019s hurt and angry but mostly hurt. EXT. LADY BIRD\u2019S FRONT YARD. NIGHT The kids all pile back into Danny\u2019s car. Lady Bird waves goodbye, all of them laughing. Then they are gone. Lady Bird shivers a little, now alone. Startles when she sees Shelly smoking:  LADY BIRD  (curious) Why does that cigarette look so weird? Like not like cigarette? 44.    Shelly offers her a drag. Lady Bird drags and coughs. SHELLY It\u2019s a clove. Lick your lips. That\u2019s why they\u2019re sweet. (then) Your Mom was really sad you weren\u2019t here tonight for Thanksgiving. LADY BIRD Well, she hates me. SHELLY She has a big heart, your Mom. She took me in after my parents freaked out about, whatever, pre-marital sex. I admire her. Lady Bird doesn\u2019t fight Shelly. INT. XAVIER. GIRLS DRESSING ROOM. EARLY EVENING. ` Buzzing in the girls dressing room. It\u2019s opening night!  They are putting up pictures and do-dads. They are exchanging \u201copening night\u201d gifts. The girls are applying too much makeup. There is music playing and lots of screaming. INT. XAVIER. BOYS DRESSING ROOM. EARLY EVENING. The boys also get ready. They are putting on powder and combing their hair. It\u2019s less loud, but also kinetic.  INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. EARLY EVENING.  All the boys and girls are gathered in a circle. Father Leviatch and Miss Patty are leading the prayer.  FATHER LEVIATCH SAINT IGNATIUS OF LOYOLA... EVERYONE (shouts) PRAY FOR US! DANNY LIVE JESUS IN OUR HEARTS... 45.    EVERYONE FOREVER!  They break and cheer. It\u2019s time for the show. INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT. The show is about to begin. The audience sits in the dark. The students in the wings. The paltry orchestra strikes up the first chord.  MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG is actually a pretty upsetting and adult show. Julie sings a song about divorce. The other \u201cfabulous\u201d girl, Diana, plays a character who has an affair. There\u2019s lots of pretend drinking of alcohol. They dance and sing their hearts out  Everyone cheers at the end, but more about the fact of the show as opposed to the show itself.  The audience includes the whole of Lady Bird\u2019s family, Julie\u2019s Mom and Uncle Matt, Danny\u2019s whole Irish-Catholic clan. Everyone is proud. INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT.  Mingling after the show. Some of the administrators look scandalized.  Julie sees Mr. Bruno and approaches him, feeling beautiful and confident:  MR. BRUNO There she is! Jules, wow! You were so good. I couldn\u2019t believe that. JULIE Thank you... MR. BRUNO Jules, I\u2019d like you to meet my wife, Becky. Becky this is Jules, one of my brightest students. BECKY Nice to meet you. JULIE (devastated) Nice to meet you, too. MR. BRUNO How we doing? 46.    BECKY Yeah, I\u2019m a little tired. MR. BRUNO Okay, I gotta get her home, we\u2019ve got the little one, but great work Jules.  JULIE (as they leave) Congratulations.  Julie is humiliated, and doesn\u2019t quite know why. She sits down next to Father Leviatch, who also looks traumatized. He watches people pass him by: FATHER LEVIATCH They didn\u2019t understand it INT. DINER. NIGHT.  The entire cast and crew is there, enjoying their opening night, eating a lot of chicken fingers and french fries. They are being silly and playing a Broadway trivia game.

Lady Bird opens the door and opens a stall and there, in front of her: Danny and Greg making out hard. Julie comes tumbling in from behind. INT. JULIE\u2019S ROOM. JULIE\u2019S HOUSE. NIGHT.  They both cry. They listen to \u201cCrash Into Me\u201d by Dave Matthews and sob. The song ends and Lady Bird starts it over. INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT. They perform the next night. No fun. It\u2019s no fun because their boyfriends are gay. INT. DOCTOR\u2019S OFFICE. DAY. Lady Bird gets her cast off with a saw. Marion watches. The doctor throws the cast in the trash. She is mournful. INT. ST. FRANCIS. DAY. Finals. Lady Bird casually cheats off the girl sitting next to her. INT. LIVING ROOM. CHRISTMAS DAY. Everyone gets socks and underwear for Christmas. Even Shelly. MARION They\u2019re really nice socks. MARION They\u2019re expensive, actually. They wick moisture away from your feet. SHELLY Yeah my feet always have moisture. LADY BIRD Mom, I love them. 48.    MARION (embarrassed) I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s Small Christmas. We wanted to, well, it\u2019s just a little small this year. Larry opens his gift. (laughing) It\u2019s just what I needed, honey.  He holds up a throw pillow that says \u201cGolfers Don\u2019t Diet They Just Exist On Greens.\u201d He laughs. MARION (laughing, too) It makes me laugh. INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S ROOM. NIGHT. A gentle knock on the door. LADY BIRD (O.S.) Dad? Come in. LARRY (entering) How did you know it was me? LADY BIRD Mom doesn\u2019t knock. LARRY (laughs) No, she doesn\u2019t. He gives her an envelope. Quietly says: LARRY (CONT\u2019D) Here they are, your completed financial aid applications. Merry Christmas. Lady Bird throws her arms around Larry. LADY BIRD Thank you! Thank you! LARRY Do you need money for the applications? Because I can help with that, too, I just need to -- 49.    LADY BIRD -- no, no, I\u2019ve got that, summer jobs covered it. INT. FAMILY/COMPUTER/MIGUEL\u2019S ROOM. COMPUTER. DAY.  Lady Bird frantically fills out her applications: addresses things, puts materials in envelopes. MIGUEL This is why we have computer shut- off time - this is our room. He indicates Shelly, looking forlorn by the pullout sofa-bed. LADY BIRD Okay, okay, just can you drive me to the post office on J? It should still be open.  EXT. POST OFFICE. NIGHT.  They are just closing up for the night. Lady Bird runs up and posts them at the last minute. EXT. LADY BIRD\u2019S HOUSE. PORCH. MIDNIGHT.  Lady Bird and her family are out celebrating New Years. Noise makers and sparklers. Happy 2003! Everyone wears the glasses with the zeros for the eyes. INT. NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. AFTERNOON. This is where she got high the first time and the band played - now Lady Bird learns the cash-register, espresso machine, and then sees Kyle Scheible, that amazing looking bassist, sitting at a table outside, plowing through \u201cThe People\u2019s History of the United States.\u201d Later, he steps outside to smoke, she notices and follows: LADY BIRD Hey! I like your band with Jonah Ruiz, L'enfance Nue? (she pronounces it Lenfance New) KYLE (correcting her pronunciation) L\u2019enfance Nue. LADY BIRD I saw your Thanksgiving show. My name\u2019s Lady Bird.  50.    They shake hands. There is something instantly sexual between them. Lady Bird has never felt this thing before. She gets all R&B songs ever written in one moment. KYLE It\u2019s weird you shake hands.  LADY BIRD Yeah.(lying) Yeah, I\u2019m friends with Jenna and she\u2019s always talking about how great your band is so I wanted to check it out. KYLE Jenna\u2019s hella tight. Well maybe I\u2019ll see you at the Deuce or something.  LADY BIRD Sure, see you at the Deuce. COOL TWENTY SOMETHING (yelling out to Lady Bird) I\u2019m not paying you to flirt! LADY BIRD (embarrassed) I wasn\u2019t flirting. KYLE I wish you had been. And then he\u2019s gone. Lady Bird\u2019s loins are on fire. INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S ROOM. NIGHT. She writes Kyle\u2019s name next to where she\u2019d written Danny\u2019s name. Touches her hand where he\u2019d touched it. Then touches her mouth. She wants, she wants. 50.    SECOND SEMESTER INT. CHURCH. DAY.  Joint liturgy at another beginning of the semester. Lady Bird sits next to Julie and sings in the choir and scans for Kyle.  From under her choir robe, Lady Bird pulls out \u201cThe People\u2019s History of the United States\u201d and reads it while the priest delivers the homily.  Danny tries to make eye contact with Lady Bird but she coldly looks away. Her eyes rest on Jenna - she wants Kyle as her boyfriend and Jenna as her friend. She wants to be part of this thing, this popular-straight-kid thing she\u2019s always been outside of. Lady Bird takes her blessing, arms crossed. INT. HOMEROOM. DAY. JENNA The first time we did it was at his lake house last summer. It was so funny... Julie hands Lady Bird a sack lunch: JULIE From Uncle Matt. I think he and my Mom are fighting, so enjoy these lunches while you can. LADY BIRD Oh, no thanks, I\u2019m trying to lose weight. JULIE Really?  But Lady Bird isn\u2019t paying attention. She\u2019s angling towards Jenna Walton, the tan, who holds court: JENNA Yeah, sex is not a big deal, it\u2019s just my mom called during it! Everyone laughs. 51.    JENNA (CONT\u2019D) It was on my cell phone, she got it for emergencies. LADY BIRD Did you pick up? JENNA Yeah, I was like, um, Mom, I can't really talk right now. Everyone else laughs again. Julie now tries to join in: JULIE (to Jenna) What was the emergency? JENNA What? Oh, my great aunt died. JULIE What was the emergency? JENNA Oh, my great aunt died. LADY BIRD I'm so sorry. JENNA She kind of  did it to herself. Yeah. I don\u2019t know why do that if you\u2019re already so old.  Sister Sarah-Joan approaches: SISTER SARAH-JOAN Ladies - skirts?  Jenna's skirt doesn\u2019t make the grade, it\u2019s been hemmed.  SISTER SARAH-JOAN (CONT\u2019D) I\u2019m going to write you a citation, Miss Walton. 52.    SISTER SARAH-JOAN No more short skirts! She continues on, inspecting other skirts. JENNA Sarah-Joan is all up in my jock. LADY BIRD She\u2019s a cunt. JULIE Birdy you like her. LADY BIRD Yeah, but, she\u2019s a cunt. (to Jenna) I have an idea of how to get Sarah- Joan back... JENNA How? LADY BIRD You\u2019ll see. This afternoon? JULIE No, we have auditions this afternoon. LADY BIRD I don\u2019t think I want to do the play. (to Jenna) Meet me in the teacher\u2019s parking lot at 3. I\u2019ll have the materials. JENNA Wait what was your name? LADY BIRD Lady Bird. JENNA Weird.  SISTER SARAH-JOAN We have a decision to make: prom themes! The top options are -- Cities of the World, Eternal Flame, and Movies! INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. DAY.  Everyone who has come to audition is greeted by the new director: Father Walther, also the JV football coach. GIRL #1 53.  Where\u2019s Father Leviatch? FATHER WALTHER Alright let\u2019s have everyone take a knee. Confusion. Miss Patty won\u2019t make eye contact with them   MISS PATTY Cozy sit. FATHER WALTHER So I know that you all miss Father Leviatch, all of the brothers do too, but I am going to give this my very best shot, okay? Usually I\u2019m the J.V. football coach, but from what I can tell a \u201cplay\u201d is a \u201cplay.\u201d No real response. Danny sits with Julie, whispers: DANNY Where\u2019s Lady Bird? JULIE (quietly angry) With her new best friend. She thinks she\u2019s too cool for theatre. Father Walther wheels out a blackboard and picks up chalk. FATHER WALTHER Now if you can pull out your scripts. I\u2019ve assigned a number to each of your roles. I\u2019m going to put the blocking on this board, and if you guys can transcribe into your plays, that\u2019d be great. JULIE (calling out) Who is playing what part? FATHER WALTHER I had Miss Patty assign parts because she already knows you all. Miss Patty nods.  FATHER WALTHER (CONT\u2019D) Call \u2018em out Miss Patty! Miss Patty starts: 54.    MISS PATTY (slightly drunk on power) Uh, Prospero, Danny.  Julie is Miranda - she\u2019s happy, maybe she\u2019s good at this? EXT. TEACHER PARKING LOT. AFTERNOON. Jenna and Lady Bird are decorating the nun mini-van with tin cans and streamers and attach a sign to the back that reads: JUST MARRIED TO JESUS. As they\u2019re completing their mission: JENNA Wait, where do you live? LADY BIRD Oh, um, the 40s. JENNA That\u2019s where our starter house was! Which street? LADY BIRD (lying, again) Um, 44th it\u2019s, um, it\u2019s the three story blue house with the white shutters and the American flag in the front.  She describes the house that she and Julie lusted after last fall, Danny\u2019s Grandmother\u2019s house. JENNA I know that one! Wanna go over there now and eat? I live in Granite Bay otherwise I\u2019d say lets go there.  LADY BIRD Um, actually, I was thinking - maybe we should go to the Deuce? (trying to be casual) I was talking to Kyle about it and he was like \u201cwhatever it\u2019s lame but maybe I\u2019ll see you there.\u201d JENNA How do you know Kyle? 55.    LADY BIRD My Mom made me get a job at New Helvetia to learn \u201cresponsibility\u201d Anyway we hang out there. JENNA Yeah, Kyle\u2019s awesome. let\u2019s Deuce it up. INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. DAY.  Father Walther is writing all the blocking on the blackboard like the football coach he is. All the students are frantically taking down the notes in their scripts. EXT. SIERRA II. \u201cTHE DEUCE.\u201d PARKING LOT. DAY.  Jenna joins Jonah & co in the parking lot, drinking and smoking. Kyle is there, sitting on top of a car reading another big book, a theoretical math book. For fun. LADY BIRD This is the Deuce? It\u2019s a parking lot? We were in one parking lot and we went to another parking lot. JENNA (calling out) KYLE! Lady Bird and I just decorated the nun-mobile like \u201cjust married to Jesus! KYLE That\u2019s hella tight.  He nods, appreciating this. Jonah starts to make out with Jenna. Lady Bird tries not to watch. KYLE (CONT\u2019D) What you did was very baller, very anarchist.  LADY BIRD Yeah, fuck \u2018em. KYLE Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not gonna snitch on you. LADY BIRD (fake threatening) I hope not, because I\u2019d fucking kill your family. 56.    What?  KYLE  LADY BIRD Sorry that was an exaggeration. KYLE It\u2019s okay. My Dad has cancer. So I guess God is doing that for us. LADY BIRD Oh... I\u2019m sorry. They\u2019re quiet for a second, he\u2019s said something heavy. KYLE You work at New Helvetia, right? LADY BIRD Right. KYLE Can I get your number? We were looking to set up some more gigs down there... LADY BIRD Definitely.  He holds out his hand and a pen. Lady Bird takes his hand and the pen. When she touches him, it\u2019s the same as before: SEX. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) It\u2019s my parents\u2019 number. KYLE You don\u2019t have a cell phone? LADY BIRD Nah. KYLE Good girl. The government didn\u2019t have to put tracking devices on us, we bought them and put them on ourselves.  LADY BIRD I don\u2019t own a tracking device... KYLE No the cell phones. See? 57.    Wow.  LADY BIRD  KYLE Yeah. I know. I mean you\u2019ll have one eventually. Everyone\u2019s gonna have one. And then it\u2019ll be a matter of time. LADY BIRD Before what? KYLE Before they put them in our brains.  Lady Bird laughs and then stops herself. He is dead fucking serious. She wants to touch him again but can\u2019t invent a reason why. INT. NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. AFTERNOON.  Lady Bird works. Zones out from time to time, thinking about Kyle. Danny comes in and then lurks. She spots him, goes to throw out the trash, annoyed that he\u2019s there. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. AFTERNOON. Lady Bird walks out, Danny follows her. She wheels around: LADY BIRD What do you want from me? He doesn\u2019t say anything. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) YES?! DANNY My Grandma wanted me to tell you she missed you at Christmas. LADY BIRD Yeah, well, I couldn\u2019t have gone anyway... my Mom was pissed about Thanksgiving. DANNY (nodding) Your mom is crazy. I\u2019m scared of her. 58.    LADY BIRD (suddenly defensive) She\u2019s not crazy, she\u2019s just, she has a big heart. She\u2019s very warm. DANNY I don\u2019t find your mother warm. LADY BIRD You don\u2019t? DANNY Well no yeah she\u2019s warm but she\u2019s also kind of scary. LADY BIRD You can\u2019t be scary and warm. DANNY (logically debating) I think you can, your Mom is.  LADY BIRD YOU\u2019RE YOU\u2019RE GAY! That shuts him up. They\u2019re quiet. DANNY (suddenly, desperate) Fuck me. Can you not tell anyone, please? I\u2019m so sorry about everything. I\u2019m so ashamed of all of it. It\u2019s going to be bad and I just need a little bit of time to figure out how I\u2019m going to tell my mom and dad. He almost starts crying. LADY BIRD (pats him awkwardly) Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell. DANNY (leaning into her,sobbing)  Thank you.    59.     He\u2019s telling the truth and she is genuinely touched. They embrace again. They are friends, real friends now. INT. PSYCH HOSPITAL. CHECK-IN. DAY.  Marion helps a patient fill out a questionnaire. It is Father Leviatch, who looks how he feels - crushed by bottomless despair. This is his struggle. MARION ...and do you have a support system?  FATHER LEVIATCH What do you mean? MARION (gently) Who do you turn to when you feel this way?  FATHER LEVIATCH No one, I guess. I\u2019m sorry. MARION No, no, don\u2019t be sorry. There\u2019s no wrong answer. She looks at him with true empathy. He realizes something. FATHER LEVIATCH Please don\u2019t tell your daughter. MARION No of course not. Of course not. 60.    INT. CHURCH. DAY.  All of Xavier and Immaculate Heart of Mary are assembled for Ash Wednesday Mass.  Everyone gets ash on their forehead.

PRIEST Remember that you are dust and to dust you shall return... Remember that you are dust and to dust you shall return.... INT. FAMILY/COMPUTER/MIGUEL\u2019S ROOM. DAY.  Lady Bird sits at the computer with a list of instructions in front of her - Marion, Larry, Shelly and Miguel stand behind her.

She is presses ENTER and is lead you to a website that lists all the schools in the UC system she applied to with a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno\u201d beside them. They all say no except for... LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) DAVIS?! MARION (relieved) Davis is good. Maybe you should have looked at it. LADY BIRD It\u2019s only half an hour away! Less if you\u2019re driving fast! LARRY I went to graduate school there. SHELLY Lots of smart people go to Davis. LADY BIRD I thought Berkeley had to accept me. You and Miguel went there. I\u2019m a legacy. 61.    LARRY Eh, not if we don\u2019t give money. MIGUEL And you get bad grades. LADY BIRD Oh what do you know about it? MIGUEL Meaning? Nothing. LADY BIRD MIGUEL (turning red)  What are you implying?  MIGUEL YOU FUCKING RACIST. LADY BIRD I didn\u2019t say anything. MIGUEL I DIDN\u2019T PUT DOWN MY RACE! LADY BIRD I\u2019m sure they had no idea, MIGUEL! MIGUEL You are actually fucking evil. What is wrong with you?    MARION GO - GO TO YOUR ROOM! LADY BIRD I\u2019m not FIVE! MARION I did not raise you like this, I didn\u2019t -- LADY BIRD I don\u2019t have to go ANYWHERE! I\u2019m not going to a fucking university that\u2019s famous for it\u2019s fucking AGRICULTURAL SCHOOL. She runs out, furious. She\u2019d kick the computer if she could.  LADY BIRD (O.S.) (CONT\u2019D) AND MIGUEL AND SHELLY YOU\u2019LL NEVER 62.  GET JOBS WITH ALL THAT SHIT IN YOUR FACE!  Miguel self-consciously puts his hand to his nose-ring, rotating it. Shelly mentally tallies all her piercings. 63.    INT. JENNA'S HOUSE. NIGHT.  A fancy McMansion, giant but not utterly tasteless. A low-key house party. Lady Bird wanders through the palatial house, looking for Jenna. Runs up to her: LADY BIRD Hey!  JENNA (hugging her) Hi! Help yourself to anything in the fridge. My parent\u2019s are upstairs but they don\u2019t care if you drink.  She nods and moves on. What she\u2019s looking for is Kyle of course. She spots Kyle outside, reading a book and smoking. EXT. JENNA'S HOUSE. BY THE POOL. NIGHT.  Lady Bird casually slinks outside and lights up a clove, like she does it all the time. Kyle notices like he was meant to. KYLE I hate that shit. LADY BIRD But you smoke. KYLE Hand rolled cigarettes - never industrially produced and never cloves. LADY BIRD What\u2019s wrong with cloves? KYLE You can\u2019t inhale cloves. What\u2019s the point? LADY BIRD Oh... KYLE You\u2019re not supposed to. LADY BIRD Cloves were what I first smoked, when I was young, so you know, force of habit. KYLE Huh. Well it has fiber glass. 64.    Really?  LADY BIRD  KYLE Rolling your own is best. Also I\u2019m trying to, as much as is possible, not participate in our economy. I don\u2019t like money. I am trying to live by bartering alone. LADY BIRD But doesn\u2019t Catholic school cost money?  KYLE Yeah the diocese were not super into it. (then) It mattered to my Dad that I go to Xavier, so just trying to make him happy.  She sits down next to him. He touches her face. She breathes out hard. He kisses her and she kisses back.  CUT TO:  Another part of the house: Kyle and Lady Bird are making out full on. She wants it, but not so fast: LADY BIRD I don\u2019t want to have sex yet. I haven\u2019t had sex yet. With another person. KYLE No, me neither. LADY BIRD Really? Yeah. Cool.  KYLE LADY BIRD They start making out again. They fall into a door and it reveals THE FAMOUS TANNING BED. Lady Bird laughs. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Oh my god! It\u2019s the tanning bed! Julie will love this! 65.    KYLE Who\u2019s Julie? INT. BATHROOM. DAY.  Lady Bird sits on the edge of the tub and looks at a picture of Kyle from the \u201cXavier\u201d insert in the Immaculate Heart of Mary Yearbook.  CUT TO:  Just Lady Bird\u2019s feet on either side of the tub-tile, the water streaming down. It\u2019s obvious what she\u2019s doing. CUT TO:  She\u2019s out. She has towels wrapped around her body and head. She rummages around the medicine cabinet. She sees a pill bottle and looks at it. It\u2019s antidepressants for her Dad. She puts it back, carefully. MARION (O.S.) Lady Bird! You can\u2019t lock yourself in there! We have one bathroom! LADY BIRD (opening the door) Sorry, sorry, sorry! LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) It\u2019s just this is the only place I can get any privacy. Marion clocks the towels around Lady Bird\u2019s head and body: MARION Do you really need to use two towels?  LADY BIRD No, I guess no. MARION If you need two towels you just have to say so because this affects my whole day, I have to do laundry before work and I need to know if there are more towels I need to wash.  LADY BIRD I just need one, sorry. 66.    MARION OK, well let me get to the mirror, I gotta get going. Lady Bird backs up, watches Marion put on makeup. LADY BIRD When do you think is a normal time to have sex? MARION (drops her mascara) You\u2019re having sex? LADY BIRD No! MARION Uh, college is good, I think college. Use protection. Like we talked about.  LADY BIRD Ok.  They regard each other.  LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Is Dad depressed? MARION (looking from the mirror) Why do you ask that? LADY BIRD The pills... they have Dad\u2019s name on them. Marion\u2019s not sure she should talk about it, but then does: MARION Dad\u2019s been struggling with depression for years.  LADY BIRD I didn\u2019t know that. 67.    MARION Money is not life\u2019s report card. LADY BIRD He\u2019s depressed about money? MARION Being successful doesn\u2019t mean anything in and of itself. It just means that you\u2019re successful. LADY BIRD (confused) Yeah, but then you\u2019re successful. MARION But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re happy. LADY BIRD But he\u2019s not happy. EXT. JENNA\u2019S HOUSE. POOL. DAY.  Lady Bird and Jenna messing around in her big pool, splashing each other, being teenage ladies-of-leisure. Lady Bird is feeling the weight of her life, the heft of it. LADY BIRD I have to get out of Sacramento. JENNA Why? LADY BIRD Because it\u2019s soul-killing. It\u2019s the mid-west of California. JENNA Isn\u2019t there a thing, like: \u201cthink globally, act locally.\u201d LADY BIRD I feel that the person who said that didn\u2019t live in Sacramento. JENNA I love it here. I want to send my daughters to Immaculate Heart. I want to be, you know, be a mom.  68.    LADY BIRD At least go to San Francisco. JENNA I don't like hills.  Jenna disappears under the water. Lady Bird considers that perhaps Jenna is not such a good fit for her as a friend, even if she is popular and cool. They aren\u2019t the same. INT. ALGEBRA II CLASS. DAY.  Julie\u2019s desk is empty beside Lady Bird. She misses her real friend. INT. ST. FRANCIS HALLWAYS. DAY.  Lady Bird sees Julie walking in the hallway with Darlene, the weird girl from choir. She calls out: LADY BIRD Julie! Julie! Julie, hey! DARLENE (aggressive) What do you want from Julie? LADY BIRD Darlene can you excuse us? JULIE Darlene, stay. So Darlene stays, her creepy cow eyes taking in the scene. LADY BIRD Why aren\u2019t you in Algebra II? JULIE I switched sections. LADY BIRD Why? 69.    JULIE Aren\u2019t Jenna and Kyle enough? LADY BIRD I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re jealous. JULIE HA! Jenna is a moron, you know. LADY BIRD She\u2019s not. She\u2019s in AP Calculus. JULIE She\u2019s a moron in a deeper sense. LADY BIRD You don\u2019t even know her.  JULIE -- Miss Patty assigned you a role, by the way. You just never showed up to claim it. LADY BIRD What role? JULIE \u201cThe Tempest.\u201d LADY BIRD There is no role of \u201cThe Tempest.\u201d JULIE It\u2019s the titular role! LADY BIRD No, it\u2019s a made up thing so we all can participate. JULIE Can\u2019t do anything unless you\u2019re the center of attention, can you? LADY BIRD Yeah, well, you know your mom's tits? They're FAKE. TOTALLY FAKE. JULIE She made a bad decision at 19! LADY BIRD Two bad decisions. 70.    Julie leaves with Darlene. Lady Bird is furious and righteous. INT. IMMACULATE HEART OF MARY GYM. DAY.  Everyone sits on the bleachers for a \u201cspecial assembly.\u201d Jenna and Lady Bird sit together. Lady Bird loves being seen with her at this public event.  A woman is speaking - she is heavy-set with a \u201cwedge\u201d haircut. She holds up models of fetuses. 70.   CASEY And at fifteen, this girl was pregnant. She decided that she was going to get an abortion. It made sense. It was the right thing to do.  LADY BIRD (whispering) Let me guess she didn\u2019t get it. CASEY And she was sitting there waiting for the doctor to come in and something deep inside her said NO. LADY BIRD Bingo. CASEY Anyone want to guess who this woman is? Hands shoot up.  CASEY (CONT\u2019D) The young lady right here. YOUNG LADY You? 71.    CASEY No, it was not me. ANOTHER YOUNG LADY Um, your friend? CASEY No, the girl in the story was... my mother. Gasps from the audience. CASEY (CONT\u2019D) I am that baby that she decided not to abort.   Cut to: Laminated graphics about abortion are being passed around.  CASEY (CONT\u2019D) That could have been me, that could have been my fate. LADY BIRD (to Jenna) Just because something looks ugly doesn\u2019t mean that it is morally wrong. Unfortunately this comment was loud enough for Casey to hear. CASEY What did you say, ma\u2019am? LADY BIRD Nothing. CASEY Please share.  Lady Bird looks at Jenna and decides that she\u2019s really going to impress her:  LADY BIRD (loud) I said \u201cJust because something looks ugly doesn\u2019t mean that it is morally wrong.\u201d The girls are shocked and embarrassed, but laughing too. 72.    CASEY You think dead children aren\u2019t morally wrong? LADY BIRD No... She\u2019s going all in: LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) I\u2019m just saying that if you took up close pictures of my vagina while I was on my period it would be disturbing but it doesn\u2019t make it wrong.  GASPS! Sister Sarah-Joan clocks Lady Bird\u2019s escalating mania. She briefly makes eye-contact with her. Lady-Bird is ashamed, but uses her shame to plow ahead rather than turn back. CASEY (horrified) Excuse me? What did you say? LADY BIRD Listen, if your mother had had the abortion we wouldn't have to sit through this stupid assembly?  MARION (O.S.) Suspended?! HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?! INT. FAMILY/COMPUTER/MIGUEL\u2019S ROOM. NIGHT. Marion is furious. Larry pretends to work on the computer.   MARION EVERYTHING we do is for you. EVERYTHING. You think I like driving that car around. Do you? You think I like working double shifts at the psych hospital? You needed to go to the Catholic school because your brother saw someone knifed in front of him at the public school, is that what you want? MARION (turns on Larry)     LADY-BIRD  No. No. No. No....  LARRY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON THE COMPUTER?!   Nothing. 73.  LARRY  MARION (back to Lady Bird) You think Dad and I don\u2019t know how ashamed that you are of us? Your dad knows, your dad knows why you ask us to drop you a block away from school every day - LADY BIRD - Dad I didn\u2019t mean to - MARION - You made him feel horrible HORRIBLE do you know that? LADY BIRD (crying) I\u2019m sorry.  Larry chimes in. 74.    LARRY Marion you didn\u2019t have to bring that up - MARION - No, Larry, you can\u2019t just be the nice guy, she has to know, she has to know how you feel otherwise she\u2019s just gonna think that she can say anything at all and nobody ever gets hurt.\u201dWrong side of the tracks\u201d. LADY BIRD I didn\u2019t mean it that way, it was a joke --  MARION Yeah, it\u2019s just a joke: \u201cMom and Dad, they don\u2019t care.\u201d We didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be in this house for twenty-five years, we thought we\u2019d move somewhere better, Whatever we give you, it\u2019s never enough. LADY BIRD It is enough.  MARION Do you have any idea how much it cost to raise you? How much you\u2019re THROWING away every day?  Lady Bird, tired of being berated, furiously gets a pen and a piece of paper, poised to write, cuts Marion off: LADY BIRD Give me a number. MARION What? LADY BIRD GIVE ME A NUMBER! MARION I don\u2019t understand. LADY BIRD You give me a number for how much it cost to raise me, and I\u2019m going to get older and make a lot of money and write you a check for what I owe you so that I NEVER HAVE TO SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN. 75.    MARION I highly doubt that you will be able to get a job good enough to do that.  Lady Bird screams and raises her hand at her mother. Brings it down without striking. Leaves the room without a sound. INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S HOUSE. EARLY AFTERNOON.  Lady Bird lounging - watching television. Life during Suspension. All these reports about the lead up to the Iraq war. It\u2019s simultaneously terrifying and boring. The phone rings and she JUMPS at it. LADY BIRD (into the phone) Hello?  JENNA (O.S.) Hi, it\u2019s me! Jenna. LADY BIRD (looking at the time) Are you calling me from school? JENNA (O.S.) No, we got out early because all the Irish girls got totally sloshed by noon... LADY BIRD Oh, right, happy Saint Patrick\u2019s Day!  JENNA (O.S.) I guess they\u2019d been stock-piling mini liquor bottles in the tampon machines. Now they\u2019re all throwing up. Everyone else got out early. So GUESS where I am?! LADY BIRD I don\u2019t know, where? Reveal that Jenna is: EXT. DREAM HOUSE. EARLY AFTERNOON.  It is the house. Danny\u2019s Grandmother\u2019s house. The blue one with the white shutters and the American Flag. The one Lady Bird said she lived in. Jenna is standing there in her uniform. 76.    JENNA DING DONG I\u2019M OUTSIDE! She rings the doorbell. LADY BIRD (O.S.) Oh, shit, no, I\u2019m... wait.  LADY BIRD (O.S.) LEAVE! JUST UM, LEAVE!   INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S KITCHEN. EARLY AFTERNOON.              CUT TO:  Lady Bird and Jenna in her kitchen. Her real kitchen. JENNA (looking around) So this is your house? LADY BIRD Yeah. JENNA The woman who lived in the other house was totally freaked out. LADY BIRD That\u2019s my friend\u2019s grandma. That\u2019s her house.  JENNA Why did you say it was your house? Reaching for the truth that explains it: LADY BIRD I wished I lived in that house.  JENNA I don\u2019t even sort of understand why somebody would lie about that. 77.    LADY BIRD I didn\u2019t lie. JENNA You lied, you\u2019re a liar. JENNA I hate dishonesty. LADY BIRD I\u2019m sorry. JENNA Apology accepted, I guess. LADY BIRD (concerned) Are we still friends? JENNA I mean, if you\u2019re still Kyle\u2019s girlfriend, then yeah, I guess I\u2019ll see you around. Lady Bird looks worried - is she still Kyle\u2019s girlfriend? INT. KYLE\u2019S ROOM. KYLE\u2019S HOUSE. DAY. They watch the news, not touching but oh man she wants to touch.  CUT TO:  Kyle and Lady Bird are making out pretty heavily. Lady Bird is on top. She whispers: LADY BIRD I\u2019m ready. KYLE (regular voice) What?  LADY BIRD (a bit louder) I\u2019m ready... to have sex... KYLE Okay, great. 78.    He reaches over, fetches a condom. Gets it on somehow. LADY BIRD You\u2019re so dextrous with that... Oh!  They\u2019re sort of having sex now. She\u2019s still on top. It goes on for a little bit. Then he stops moving. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) (whispering) Are you...? Done? KYLE Yeah. Yes. LADY BIRD Sorry, I was confused. She looks at him. His face is all splotchy. KYLE You have some kind of - blood! LADY BIRD (hands to her face) Oh, shit, I get nose bleeds.  I\u2019m sorry. CUT TO:  Kyle reads. Lady Bird holds a Kleenex to her nose, and looks at a bulletin board with the class picture from first grade - little Kyle wears a tie-dye shirt. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Remember when \u201ctie-dye\u201d was an activity? 79.    KYLE (glancing up) I didn\u2019t make that shirt, my parents bought it for me at Sea Ranch, you can read \u201cSea Ranch\u201d if you look close. LADY BIRD (making a joke) Cut to \u201cten years later.\u201d KYLE What? LADY BIRD Like how ten years ago you were in first grade and now we... Cut to! KYLE (quizzical) What does \u201ccut to\u201d mean to you? LADY BIRD Or like little did he know... KYLE Nothing you're saying makes sense. LADY BIRD How we\u2019re not virgins now! We deflowered each other. We have each other\u2019s flowers. She kisses him and tries to hold him but then backs off. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Sorry, I\u2019m just happy. KYLE I didn\u2019t lose my virginity to you. LADY BIRD Wait - what? KYLE I lost my virginity to Cassie Duval.   Excuse me? LADY BIRD   80.    LADY BIRD You said you were a virgin. KYLE No I didn\u2019t. Because I\u2019m not. And I haven\u2019t lied in two years.   Oh Jesus. LADY BIRD  KYLE Yeah, I\u2019ve probably slept with, six people? LADY BIRD You don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s six people?  KYLE I don\u2019t keep a list. LADY BIRD Why wouldn\u2019t you keep a list we\u2019re in high school? KYLE Why are you getting so moody? LADY BIRD You did say you were a virgin. KYLE I think you might have made an assumption. LADY BIRD I just had a whole experience that was wrong. She sits. Kyle opens his book up again and then closes it: KYLE You're deciding to be upset. LADY BIRD No, I am upset. KYLE Because you\u2019re deciding to be. Don't be mad at me for this. That's stupid. You can't be mad at me for something I have no control over now. LADY BIRD I just wanted it to be special. 81.    KYLE Why? You\u2019re going to have so much un-special sex in your life. LADY BIRD (fully angry now) I was on top! Who the fuck is on top their first time! KYLE Do you have any awareness about how many civilians we\u2019ve killed since invasion in Iraq started? LADY BIRD SHUT UP. SHUT UP. Different things can be sad. It\u2019s not all war.  Kyle moves away and opens a book. LADY BIRD (worried) Are we still going to prom together?  KYLE Sure. Kyle has been reading something out of the corner of his eye. INT. KITCHEN. KYLE\u2019S HOUSE. DAY. Lady Bird sneaks down the stairs, still crying, trying to get away without a conversation. Through a door, she sees Kyle\u2019s Dad. He\u2019s very thin and wears lots of sweaters, obviously sick. He drinks a cup of tea. EXT. KYLE\u2019S HOUSE. DAY.  Lady Bird waits outside, sitting on the curb. The Toyota Corolla pulls up. It\u2019s Marion. Lady Bird does a double-take. INT./EXT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. EARLY EVENING. As Lady Bird climbs in the car: LADY BIRD I thought Miguel was going to pick me up. 82.    MARION Well, I was just arriving from work and... She wants to say she misses Lady Bird but instead says: MARION (CONT\u2019D) It was easier.  Lady Bird starts crying. Very hard. Marion pulls over, hugs her:  MARION (CONT\u2019D) Hey, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay.  As she\u2019s rubbing her back, Marion takes in Lady Bird\u2019s shirt, she doesn\u2019t recognize it. MARION (CONT\u2019D) What is this sweater? LADY BIRD Oh, it\u2019s just, my friend Jenna gave it to me.  MARION Who\u2019s Jenna? LADY BIRD My friend.  Marion doesn\u2019t know her daughter\u2019s friends, her t-shirts, or why she\u2019s crying. She holds Lady Bird, then thinks of something:  MARION ... want to do our favorite Sunday activity? I don\u2019t have a second shift... Lady Bird nods, it would be nice. INT./EXT. OPEN HOUSES AROUND SACRAMENTO. DAY.  Marion and Lady Bird go to all the different open houses. They love doing this. They could never buy any of them, but it is so neat to see the inside of houses you\u2019ve always known, and to imagine a different life. Where would your bed go?, etc. It\u2019s a great day. Maybe the best in a long time. Maybe ever. 83.    INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S HOUSE. DAY.  Lady Bird is back to watching television. The invasion is full on, it\u2019s the Shock and Awe portion of the Iraq war. MIGUEL Lady Bird! A bunch of things arrived for you! Lady Bird rushes in, snatches the envelopes from his hand: LADY BIRD (turning hot) Holy shit! MIGUEL Since when do you get mail? LADY BIRD I get mail. MIGUEL Whatever you\u2019re up to, it\u2019s not going to end well. INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S ROOM. DAY. She opens a bunch of letters - they are all rejections.  EXCEPT for one letter, the letter that says \u201cWait-listed.\u201d She screams silently to herself. Not yes but it\u2019s not no. INT. OFFICE BUILDING. MORNING. Larry sits across from Business Jock, just 30. BUSINESS JOCK The programmers now are, like, kids, man!  LARRY I know - but that\u2019s why I think with me you\u2019ll find something different.  BUSINESS JOCK  YEAH BUT THEY\u2019RE LIKE BABIES. LARRY I hear you, it\u2019s wild. Which is why (pointing at his resume) (MORE) 84.   LARRY (CONT'D) I got my MBA at UC Davis while still working at ISC. BUSINESS JOCK Oh, wow. That must of been a lot of work. LARRY It was. BUSINESS JOCK I heard ISC is closing now, though. LARRY I heard, yes. BUSINESS JOCK So the assholes who fired you are now closing up shop. LARRY (not feeling it) Feels good. They sit for a second. BUSINESS JOCK (looking around) Yeah... What else is supposed to happen?  LARRY Oh, I thought we were going to talk about the position.   INT. OFFICE BUILDING. WAITING ROOM. DAY.  Larry leaves his awkward interview to come get Lady Bird. She\u2019s reading a stack of old magazines. LADY BIRD How\u2019d it go? 85.    LARRY (exhausted) Let\u2019s go buy a big bag of Doritos and eat them in the car to celebrate your waitlist. LADY BIRD (laughing) Don\u2019t tell Mom! About the Doritos or the waitlist!  Then Miguel enters the waiting room. Larry and Lady Bird do a double take. Miguel looks much more conventional. Handsome, too. All his piercings are out, his tattoos covered. LARRY Oh... hi, son! LADY BIRD Wait, what are you doing here? MIGUEL I guess we\u2019re um, going for the same job then? LARRY It looks like it. Go get \u2018em! Larry and Miguel hug.   Miguel goes in to the interview. Larry watches him go, feeling how you\u2019d be feeling at that moment. Lady Bird aches for her Dad. INT. VICE PRINCIPAL SISTER SARAH-JOAN'S OFFICE. DAY.  Lady Bird hands in homework from being suspended. Sarah-Joan looks it over, then:  SISTER SARAH-JOAN I know it was you who did the \u201cJust Married\u201d thing. LADY BIRD It wasn\u2019t me. SISTER SARAH-JOAN I\u2019m not going to punish you. 86.    LADY BIRD Oh... why not? SISTER SARAH-JOAN (laughing) It was funny. Sister Gina and I drove all the way home before we noticed people were honking. LADY BIRD Really? SISTER SARAH-JOAN To be fair, I wasn\u2019t just married to Jesus. It\u2019s been forty years...  LADY BIRD Well he\u2019s a lucky guy. SISTER SARAH-JOAN (she considers Lady Bird) I read your college essay. You clearly love Sacramento. LADY BIRD I do?  SISTER SARAH-JOAN Well, you write about Sacramento so affectionately, and with such care. LADY BIRD I was just describing it. SISTER SARAH-JOAN It comes across as love. LADY BIRD Sure, I guess I pay attention. SISTER SARAH-JOAN Don\u2019t you think maybe they are the same thing? Love and attention? 87.    INT. THRIFT TOWN. DAY.  Marion and Lady Bird are looking for a prom dress. Lady Bird is in the dressing room trying things on. MARION (sadly) I guess you won\u2019t be going to dances in college. This is our last one. (then) You know, Davis has a terrific theatre. If you\u2019re still interested in theatre. Are you? Lady Bird comes out in a dress, it\u2019s too tight: LADY BIRD I\u2019m probably no good at acting. (looking at herself) Why don\u2019t I look like the girls in the magazines? MARION It\u2019s too bad I can\u2019t meet this Kyle before prom. LADY BIRD He\u2019s not my boyfriend anymore. I mean, maybe he never even was. MARION I\u2019d still like to meet him. LADY BIRD (O.S.) (re: the dress) IT\u2019S TOO TIGHT! FUCK. Lady Bird goes back into the dressing room. MARION I suggested you not take that second helping of pasta...  LADY BIRD MOM! 88.    MARION (innocent) Honey, you seem upset about it, I\u2019m trying to help you. LADY BIRD Mom! You\u2019re giving me an eating disorder! LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) (to herself) I wish I could get an eating disorder.  Lady Bird comes out again. The dress kind of fits her. It\u2019s bright pink and frilly. She looks happy: LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) I love it. Smiles up at her Mom, looking for approval: MARION (considering) Is it too pink?  Lady Bird silently goes back into the dressing room. Her Mom just crushed something that she liked and was very \u201cher.\u201d Marion picks up that she\u2019s upset: MARION (CONT\u2019D) What? LADY BIRD (O.S.) Why can\u2019t you say I look nice? MARION I thought you didn\u2019t even care what I think.  LADY BIRD (O.S.) I still want you to think I look good.  MARION I\u2019m sorry, I was telling you the truth. Do you want me to lie? LADY BIRD (O.S.) No, I just wish... I wish that you liked me. 89.    MARION Of course I love you. Lady Bird comes out. Looks at Marion with the pure question: LADY BIRD But do you like me? MARION (faltering) ...I want you to be the very best version of yourself you can be. LADY BIRD What if this is the best version? INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S HOUSE. NIGHT.  Lady Bird all dressed up in her pink dress. The one Marion didn\u2019t like. Miguel, Shelly and Larry wait with her. She keeps checking the window. SHELLY You look really pretty.    Really? Shelly nods. LADY BIRD    SHELLY You look like a bad ass girl in a band.  This makes Lady Bird feel pretty amazing. Then a car horn honks. It\u2019s Kyle. He literally honks. LADY BIRD Um, I guess, that\u2019s my date. LARRY You aren\u2019t going to get in the car with a guy who honks, are you? LADY BIRD I think, yes, I am. Larry shrugs, accepting the situation. LARRY Let me get your picture. Mom\u2019s pissed she had to work a double. 90.    MIGUEL (peering out the window) Even you deserve better than this.  Larry snaps a picture of Lady Bird, standing alone.  SHELLY Have a good time!  MIGUEL Yeah, good luck!  Larry snaps a picture of Lady Bird, standing alone. INT. KYLE\u2019S CAR. NIGHT. Lady Bird approaches and catches Jenna and Jonah talking in the back seat:  JONAH I think she\u2019s weird. JENNA She is weird. LADY BIRD (announcing herself) Hey guys.

LADY BIRD I actually want to go to prom. KYLE Um, okay? I mean I don\u2019t really wanna do that. LADY BIRD Can you take me to my friend Julie\u2019s house, please? KYLE Sure. JENNA Who\u2019s Julie?

They catch their breath and notice that they are on the last slice of the block of cheese.  LADY BIRD We ate all the cheese! JULIE (CONT\u2019D) It\u2019s ok, Blocks of cheese vary in size, that was a small one. LADY BIRD So small.  LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Fuck it, let\u2019s go to prom. Doesn\u2019t your Mom have a dress?  JULIE  Let\u2019s be honest, I\u2019ve had a dress for months. It\u2019s purple and you\u2019re really gonna like it. 95.   INT. PROM. NIGHT.

They watch the sun come up over Capital Bridge on the Sacramento River. Their small-town version of the sunrise scene over the Brooklyn Bridge in \u201cManhattan.\u201d  LADY BIRD People make so much noise in the movies, but it\u2019s really not a big thing, you can totally be quiet during it. JULIE Was it amazing, though? LADY BIRD (thinks) I wanted it so badly but then I found that when it happened, I really like dry humping much more.  JULIE You\u2019re NOT a virgin. LADY BIRD (excited) I can\u2019t wait for State Fair. JULIE I know! 96.    LOG RIDE!  LADY-BIRD  LOG RIDE!  JULIE  They laugh. Then:  Oh shit. What?

JULIE Well, my Dad, my real Dad, resurfaced in Yellowstone and he wants me to come out there for the summer before I start SCC. LADY BIRD Oh. JULIE I\u2019m not going anywhere to college, so it seemed like a good opportunity. LADY BIRD (trying to be happy for her) Yeah. JULIE I\u2019m going to miss the fuck out of you.

Close on Danny performing Prospero\u2019s last speech. It\u2019s beautiful: DANNY ... now I want Spirits to enforce, art to enchant, And my ending is despair, Unless I be relieved by prayer, which pierces so that it assaults mercy itself and frees all faults.

She leaves a message:  CHRISTINE Hi Mom and Dad, it\u2019s me. Christine. It\u2019s the name you gave me. It\u2019s a good one. Dad, this is more for Mom - Hey Mom: did you feel emotional the first time that you drove in Sacramento? I did and I wanted to tell you, but we weren\u2019t really talking when it happened. All those bends I\u2019ve known my whole life, and stores, and the whole thing. But I wanted to tell you. I love you. Thank you, I\u2019m... thank you.
