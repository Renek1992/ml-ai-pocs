    "script_context": "BEFORE SUNRISEbyRichard LinklaterKim KrizanFADE IN:INT. TRAIN - AFTERNOON11The Eurail rolls along.  Inside, passengers sleep, read, and stare out the windows.  A few walk up and down the aisles.  CELINE, a young woman in her mid-twenties, is curled up in her seat reading Georges Bataill\u2019s Story of the Eye.  Strikingly attractive, she plays it down by wearing no makeup, a loose-fitting vintage dress, and flat shoes.  She continues reading while taking an occasional bite of a chocolate bar.  Sitting four rows back and on the other side of the aisle, JESSE, also mid-twenties, is engrossed in Klaus Kinski\u2019s memoir, All I Need Is Love.  Casually good looking but a little scruffy, he dresses in the jeans and T-shirt mode.  Suddenly a couple, two fortyish types who have been arguing semiquietly in the seat behind Celine, start yelling at each other in German.  The WIFE takes a swipe at the newspaper the HUSBAND has been screening him behind.  WIFEWill you put down that damn newspaper and listen to me?HUSBANDWhat\u2019ve I been doing the last thirty minutes?  Would you shut up for Chrissake?WIFEYou shut up!  How dare you tell me to shut up!  It\u2019s the same damn thing all over again!  I can\u2019t believe --HUSBANDI said shut up!  I\u2019m putting down my newspaper and telling you to shut up.Celine suddenly gets up, grabs her bag, and starts looking for another seat.  A few rows back, she finds a seat across the aisle from Jesse.  Before sitting down, they make brief eye contact and kind of shake their heads and smile at the tension.  Just as she settles in and goes back to her book, the wife gets up and storms down the aisle.  Jesse and Celine follow her with their eyes, and as she passes them, they find they are looking right at each other.  He makes a funny \u201cuh-oh\u201d face.JESSEDo you have any idea what they\u2019re arguing about?  Do you speak English?CELINEYes.  But no, I don\u2019t know.  My German is not that good.(a beat)Have you ever heard that as couples get older they lose their ability to hear each other?JESSEReally?CELINESupposedly men lose their ability to hear higher-pitched sounds and women eventually lose hearing on the low end.  I guess they sort of nullify each other or something. JESSEMust be nature\u2019s way of allowing couples to grow old together and not kill each other, I guess. There\u2019s a slightly awkward moment where they don\u2019t know if they should continue talking or not.  She glances back down at her book but he keeps looking at her.  JESSE (CONT\u2019D)What are you reading?She holds up the book so he can see what it is. CELINEHow about you?He shows her what he\u2019s reading.  Neither has much to say about the other\u2019s reading material. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)There are so many weird people on the train, no?  Last week on my way to Budapest I was sitting and talking with four other people in the lounge car and it turned out that three of them had killed people. JESSENo way.2.CELINEReally.  One was a war veteran, one had murdered her boyfriend, and another had caused a bad car wreck.JESSESo you were the only one who hadn\u2019t killed anyone?CELINENo, I was one of them.  Which one do you think?She laughs and he slowly joins her. JESSEI know what you mean.  I\u2019ve met some weirdos.  There was this British guy sitting across from me the other day who kept throwing his body against the back of his chair, yelling about how we should all join together and stop the train.  He was saying, \u201cEverybody, now, we can stop technology.  All together...\u201dCELINESo what happened?He demonstrates by throwing his body against his seat. JESSEAnd you know, me and a few others tried for a while, but we couldn\u2019t stop technology. The wife who stormed away earlier suddenly comes back and the argument resumes, right in front of them. JESSE (CONT\u2019D)I was thinking about going to the lounge car sometimes soon.  You wanna go?CELINEWe better. They get up and walk to the door of their car.  He pushes the DOOR OPEN button, and as the door opens, he extends his hand toward her.3.JESSEOh, I\u2019m Jesse.  It\u2019s James, actually, but my whole life everyone\u2019s called me Jesse.CELINESo it\u2019s Jesse James?JESSENo, just Jesse.CELINECeline. They proceed through the door and Celine pushes the DOOR OPEN button to enter the next car.  There is some confusion as to who is opening the door for whom before Celine proceeds and jesse follows her toward the lounge car. INT. LOUNGE CAR - AFTERNOON 22They sit at a table, eating chips and taking an occasional swig from a drink. JESSESo how do you speak such good English?CELINEI went to school for a summer in Los Angeles and I\u2019ve spent some time in London.  How do you speak such good English?JESSEI\u2019m American. CELINEI know.  It\u2019s a joke.  I knew you were American, and, of course, you don\u2019t speak any other language. JESSEYeah, yeah, I\u2019m the dumb, vulgar American who has no culture.  But I tried.  I want you to know I took four years of French.  I tried, I was ready.  When I was in Paris, I was standing in line at the metro going, \u201cUn billet, s\u2019il vous pl\u00e2it.  4.\n(MORE)Un billet, s\u2019il vous pl\u00e2it.\u201d  And then I got up to the window, I looked up at the lady and blanked out.  \u201cUh, uh, I need a ticket for the subway.\u201d  No more French for me.(a beat)So where are you headed?CELINEBack to Paris.  My class starts next week. JESSEWhere do you go to school?CELINELa Sorbonne.  You know?JESSESure.  But you were in Budapest?CELINEYeah, I was visiting my grandmother.JESSEHow is she?CELINEOkay.  How about you - where are you going?JESSEVienna. CELINEWhat\u2019s there?JESSEI don\u2019t know.  I\u2019m flying out of there tomorrow morning. CELINEAre you on a holiday?JESSEI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m on.  I\u2019ve just been traveling around the last two or three weeks. CELINEWere you visiting friends, or just going around on your own?5.JESSE (CONT'D)JESSEI visited a friend in Madrid for a while, but mostly I\u2019ve just been...(new thought)I got one of those Eurail passes, and you know what\u2019s fascinating about traveling around?  You spend all this time trying to reach your destination, you get there, you look around, it\u2019s never exactly what you\u2019d hoped, you head off somewhere else, and hope for something better. CELINEIt\u2019s like getting ready for a party, getting there, and falling asleep.  That\u2019s why when I\u2019m traveling I kind of force myself not to expect anything from anywhere or anyone.  And then, whatever happens is a surprise.  The most insignificant thing can become an endless subject of interest, no?JESSEThat\u2019s what I like about traveling - you can sit down, maybe talk to someone interesting, see something beautiful, read a good book, and that\u2019s enough to qualify a good day.  You do that at home and everyone thinks you\u2019re a bum.CELINEI like that though.  But it\u2019s like my favorite American writers.  They describe everything you wouldn\u2019t want to live through, and yet you cannot stop reading of this exciting, boring life.  JESSESo what do you study?CELINELiterature.  But I haven\u2019t decided yet what I really want to do. JESSEDo you want to write?6.CELINEYeah, but...(new thought)I kind of had this obsession a few years ago about creating a new form of expression.  It was of course an abstract and lost quest, but I was feeling all art forms seemed used up.  I was especially rejecting words.  They seemed so rusted and dirty.  And they\u2019ve been used for such evil ends.  Sometimes, you know, language is so limited.  It\u2019s like...if you think about it...She holds her hands out fairly wide and round. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)This is an individual\u2019s mental experience and perception and...She holds her hands together and forms a small circle. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)This is how much can be expressed through language.  We just don\u2019t have words for so many of the impressions we have. She parts her hands and gestures to the large outer circle. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)So most of our life we will never be able to express to anyone. They sit there for an extended moment, neither sure what to say next.  Suddenly Jesse smiles and jokingly starts to get up. JESSESo I guess...that\u2019s it - it\u2019s been nice not communicating with you.  They both laugh. JESSE (CONT\u2019D)Really, though, I basically agree with you, and maybe it\u2019s a sad face of life, but I think it doesn\u2019t bother me that much.  Maybe I\u2019m wrong about this, but I think that lack of communication frustrates women more than men. 7.CELINEYes, because men are perfectly content to sit in front of TV all day drinking beer and watching sports. JESSEYeah, that\u2019s true, but have you ever done that?  I did it once with a friend of mine.  Drank some beer, had some chips, and watched a couple of games.  It was the first time in years I literally jumped for joy.  On some level it\u2019s sticking your head in the sand, but on another I think it must serve some tribal purpose. CELINEI actually agree with you.  I kind of like sports.  It\u2019s one of these few times when men are treated like stupid objects...I\u2019m joking.  So you haven\u2019t told me what you do.  Are you still in school?JESSENah, I never graduated from college.CELINEAre you working?JESSEI have a stupid job like everyone else. CELINEIs it boring?  You\u2019re not happy?JESSENo, it\u2019s a decent job.  I don\u2019t get paid that much.  I don\u2019t do that much. CELINESo what is the job?JESSEI write for a newspaper, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and pretty much get to do what I want there creatively, so it\u2019s okay. 8.CELINESo you write?JESSEKinda.CELINESo has this trip been good for you?JESSEYeah.  I mean, on one level, it sucked, but sitting on a train and staring out the window for days on end has actually been kind of great. CELINEWhat do you mean?JESSEI\u2019ve had an idea I probably would never have had otherwise.  Can I tell you about it? CELINEYes. JESSESome friends of mine are these cable access producers - you know, anyone can produce a program, and they have to show it.  I got really jazzed about it.  I imagined a show I want to produce that would last an entire year, twenty-four hours a day.  I want to get 365 different video producers around the world to each make their own twenty-four-hour-long document of real time, capturing life around them just as it is lived.  So it\u2019d be people waking up, taking a long shower, getting a cup of coffee and reading the paper for twenty minutes, a long drive to work.CELINEYou mean all those boring, mundane things everyone has to do every day of their life?JESSEI was going to say the poetry of day-to-day life.  9.\n(MORE)I mean, Why is your dog so great just for sleeping in the sun?  And a guy getting money out of a bank machine is a moron?CELINESo you can put on the TV at any time of the day and see what other people are doing at the same time.JESSERight.  It\u2019s like parallel lives. CELINEThat\u2019s great.  I once lived in a big apartment I was sharing with friends, and we could see ten other apartments from the window.  I would cut down the light, sit at the window, and watch them sitting on a couch doing nothing.  It was fascinating. JESSEThat\u2019s the trick.  Life is not really about drama.  That we all do the same shit and going to some market in Arabia is the same as going to Kmart in Miami.  People believe they are missing out, that everyone else has this great and exciting life and they don\u2019t.  I mean, we all have to get dressed, feed the kids, get our driver\u2019s licence renewed, look up what time the afternoon matinee starts, lose ourselves in entertainment, lose ourselves in sex, routine, getting a little too drunk, buying a present for someone you don\u2019t like very much - you feel guilty about not liking them, so you spend a little too much money. CELINESo, it\u2019s like a National Geographic  program on people. JESSEExactly.10.JESSE (CONT'D)CELINEI can see it: twenty-four boring hours and a three-minute sex scene where he falls asleep right after. JESSEExactly.  And that would be an exciting episode.  Maybe you and your friends can do one of those episodes from Paris.  The key to making this work would be in the distribution.  Getting the tapes from town to town on time...But it would play continuously twenty-four hours for a year on stations around the world. The waiter finally arrives and gives them the menus.INT. LOUNGE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON 33Some time has passed.  They have dirty dishes in front of them.  They seem more relaxed with each other, more forthright, less self-conscious, a little more intimate. CELINEMy parents have never really spoken of the possibility of my falling in love or getting married or having children.  Even as a little girl, they wanted me to think about a future career as a TV newscaster, or a dentist, or something like that. JESSE(smiles)Anchorwoman...CELINEYeah, I\u2019d say to my dad I wanted to be a writer and he\u2019d say journalist.  I\u2019d say I wanted to have a refuge for stray cats and he\u2019d say veterinarian.  I\u2019d say I wanted to be an actress and he\u2019d say TV newscaster.  It was this constant conversion of my fanciful ambitions into practical moneymaking ventures.  11.JESSEParents just want you to have a nice career so they can tell their friends something interesting.(a beat)I musta had a pretty decent bullshit detector when I was a kid.  I always knew when they were lying to me.  By the time I was in highschool, I was dead set on listening to what everyone thought I should be doing with my life and then almost systematically doing the opposite.  They weren\u2019t really mean about it.  All their typical ambitions sounded so mediocre. CELINEIf you have parents that never fully contradict anything you want to do and are basically nice and supportive, it makes it harder to officially complain.  Even when they are wrong.  It\u2019s this passive-aggressive shit.  I can\u2019t stand it. Jesse takes a swig of water and chews some ice. JESSEYeah, but despite plenty of bullshit, I still remember being a kid as a magical time. (a beat)I remember my mom explaining death to me, and telling me that my great- grandmother in Florida had died.  The whole family had just visited them.  I must have been three, three and a half years old.  Anyway, I was playing in the backyard a day or so later, and my sister had taught me how to spray the garden hose into the sun and see a rainbow.  Well, I was spraying it and through the mist I could see my great-grandmother standing there, just kind of smiling, looking at me.  I just held the hose in that position for a long time and looked at her.  Finally, I took my thumb off the nozzle, let the hose go, and she disappeared.  12.\n(MORE)My parents gave me this rap about how I imagined it and how when people die you never see them again.  But, I knew what I had seen, and even though I\u2019ve never seen anything like that since, I\u2019ve never really been very afraid of death.  CELINEThat\u2019s good you can have that attitude toward death.  I think I am afraid of death twenty-four hours a day.  That\u2019s why I\u2019m on the train.  I could have flown to Paris.  I\u2019m just afraid of flying.  Even though statistics say it\u2019s safer, I can\u2019t help it.  When I\u2019m sitting in a plane, I already can see an explosion, me falling through the clouds.  I\u2019m so afraid of the few seconds of consciousness before dying.  I mean, when you know for sure you\u2019re gonna die.  I can\u2019t help anticipating the worst.  Like, I was in the park with this friend of mine.  There were little kids playing around.  This mother was throwing her child up in the air.  My friend was smiling and thought it was so wonderful, and all I could think of was her dropping it.  I could already see all the blood on the ground.  The big panic, the mother crying...I think like this all the time.  It\u2019s exhausting. We see out the window that the train is pulling into Vienna.CELINE (CONT\u2019D)This is Vienna.  You get off here, no?JESSEDrag.  I wish I would have met you earlier.  I really like talking to you. CELINEIt was really nice talking to you, too. 13.JESSE (CONT'D)JESSEI\u2019ve hardly talked to anyone in weeks. EXT. TRAIN STATION - LATE AFTERNOON 44The train comes to a final stop.  The doors open and soon everyone is unboarding and boarding.INT. LOUNGE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON 55With a slight smile, Jesse looks intensely at Celine. JESSEI have an admittedly insane thought.  If I don\u2019t ask you this, it\u2019ll be one of those things that will haunt me forever. CELINEWhat?He just looks at her a little nervously and can\u2019t say it.  She is truly intrigued and a little excited at what he\u2019s struggling with. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)What?JESSEI want to keep talking with you.  I mean, I have no idea what your situation is, but I feel some kind of...connection.  CELINEYeah, me too. JESSESo how about this.  Okay, good...I want you to get off her in Vienna with me.  We can check out the town. She smiles at the thought but is not totally sure. CELINESo what would we do?14.JESSEI don\u2019t know.  All I know is I\u2019m getting on this Austria Airlines flight at nine-thirty tomorrow morning and I can\u2019t really afford a hotel and we\u2019ll probably just wander around all night.  If I turn out to be a psycho, you can bail out anytime and get back on the next train, right?She\u2019s still thinking but doesn\u2019t respond.JESSE (CONT\u2019D)Think of it like this.  Jump ahead ten, twenty years.  Your marriage just doesn\u2019t have that same energy anymore.  You start to blame your husband.  You think of all the guys you\u2019ve met and all the ones you never pursued and how things might have been different if you\u2019d just picked up with one of them.  Well, I\u2019m one of them.  You can consider this traveling back in time, to see what you are missing.  See, this is really a big favor to both you and your future husband - it\u2019s a chance to see how you really haven\u2019t missed anything.  That I\u2019m just as boring and unmotivated as he is, hopefully more. She smiles a little, ponders the situation, and then just stands up. CELINEI\u2019m not sure if I got all the story, but let me get my bag. EXT. TRAIN STATION - LATE AFTERNOON 66He gets off the train with his bags and starts walking, not fully aware she\u2019s not right behind him.  She has hesitated slightly and pauses at the top of the stairs.  After glancing back briefly, she looks ahead and proceeds with confidence. INT. TRAIN STATION - LATE AFTERNOON 77Inside the busy train station lobby, they stop at a change machine and exchange currency.  15.INT. TRAIN STATION - LATE AFTERNOON 88He finishes putting his stuff in a locker.  She opens a locker and stuffs her bag in.CELINEYou know what this makes me think of?JESSEWhat?CELINEAll those people you briefly intersect with, maybe make eye contact with, and then pass by.JESSEYes, we could have done that.  Now it\u2019s like...CELINENo matter what happens, we have met. Jesse just smiles and offers up his open hand.  She touches her hand to his and there is a slow clasp and a slight pull toward one another. JESSEThat we have. EXT. BRIDGE - DAY99Walking along in silence, they both are observing what is around them and eventually look back at each other.  Fully realizing they are now committed to one another in some strange way, there is an awkward silence. CELINEIt\u2019s such a strange feeling.  When we were talking on the train, it\u2019s like we were in public - there were people around us.  Now that we\u2019re actually walking around Vienna, it\u2019s like we are all alone. JESSEI know.  It feels a little awkward.  I\u2019m not sure what we should be doing. He puts his hand on her shoulder and looks right at her. 16.JESSE (CONT\u2019D)But this is okay, though, right?CELINEYes, this is great.  Let\u2019s go to some places.  Look at your little book. He pulls out a little pamphlet/map and starts looking through it. JESSEGood.  Right.  We\u2019re in Vienna and we\u2019re going to go places.Just then two local passersby, TEX and KARL, walk past them.  Jesse stops them. JESSE (CONT\u2019D)Excuse me.  Sprechen Sie English?KARLYah, of course. TEXPerhaps you speak German for a change?JESSEWhat?TEXIt was a joke. Tex looks over at Karl, both in on it. JESSEWe just got into Vienna and we\u2019re looking for something fun to do...CELINEYeah, are there any museums we should see or anything?TEXMuseums are not exactly fun these days. Karl looks at his watch. KARLAnd they are all closing right now, anyway.  How long are you going to be here?17.JESSEJust tonight. TEXWhy did you come to Vienna?  What could you be expecting?CELINEWe\u2019re on our honeymoon...JESSEYeah, she\u2019s pregnant, so we decided to go ahead and get married. TEXI don\u2019t believe you.  You are not very good at lying. Celine and Jesse laugh while Tex and Karl talk amongst themselves in German. TEX (CONT\u2019D)Do you have the fliers?KARLYeah, I\u2019ll give them one. Karl digs in his pocket and hands a flier to them. TEXThis is a play we\u2019re both in we\u2019d like you to come to. CELINESo you are actors?TEXNot professional actors, but part-time for fun. KARLIt\u2019s a play about a cow, and an Indian searching for it.  It also has politicians, Mexicans, Russians...JESSEYou have a real cow onstage?TEXNot a real cow.  It\u2019s an actor in a cow costume. 18.KARLAnd he\u2019s the cow. TEXYes, I\u2019m the cow.  But it\u2019s a weird cow. KARLThe cow has a disease. TEXShe\u2019s acting a bit strange...acting like a dog.  If someone throws a stick, she fetches it.  She also smokes, with her hoofs. He demonstrates how one would smoke with a hoof instead of a hand.  Karl points to the bottom of the flier. KARLThe address is on the flier.  It\u2019s in the second district...TEXNear the Prater...KARLYes, the place with the big Ferris wheel.TEXThe big wheel everybody knows...KARLPerhaps you can go to the Prater before the play. JESSESo what\u2019s the name of this play?KARLIt translates as...BOTH\u201cBring Me the Horns of Wilmington\u2019s Cow.\u201dJESSESounds great.CELINECool.19.Tex puts his index finger up by his head as everyone begins to walk away. TEXI am the cow...and you will be there?JESSEWe\u2019ll try to make it. EXT. BETWEEN THE MUSEUMS - DAY1010They sit on a bench near a statue, looking up at the historic buildings and surroundings. JESSELook at this - it\u2019s beautiful.  I mean, could you imagine an American architect saying, \u201cHey, Bob, I\u2019ve got an idea.  Why don\u2019t we put a giant angel on top of this building just for people to have something beautiful to look at.\u201d  It might start out like that, but before too long it\u2019d be, \u201cSorry, Hank, boss said nix on the giant angel.  He\u2019s thinking more along the lines of a flagpole.\u201dCELINEAmericans always think Europe is perfect.  But such beauty and history can be really oppressive.  It reduces the individual to nothing.  It just reminds you all the time you are just a little speck in a long history, where in America you feel like you could be making history.  That\u2019s why I liked Los Angeles because it is so...JESSEUgly?CELINENo, I was going to say \u201cneutral.\u201d  It\u2019s like looking at a blank canvas.(a beat)20.\n(MORE)I think people go to places like Venice on their honeymoon to make sure they are not going to fight for the first two weeks of their marriage because they\u2019ll be too busy looking around at all the beautiful things.  That\u2019s what people call a romantic place - somewhere where the prettiness with contain your primary violent instinct.  A real good honeymoon spot would be like somewhere in New Jersey. EXT. TRAM STATION - DAY 1111They come down the escalator and board a tram. INT. TRAM - DAY1212They are sitting in the tram and observing everything going by.JESSEOkay, Q&A time.  We\u2019ve known each other for a little while now, we\u2019re stuck with each other, we can ask each other a few, you know, direct questions. CELINESo we ask each other questions?JESSEAnd you have to answer one hundred percent honestly.CELINEOf course.Celine picks up on the game he is talking about. JESSEFirst question.  Describe your first sexual feelings toward someone. CELINEWell, let me think...Jean-Marc Fleury.21.CELINE (CONT'D)JESSEJean-Marc Fleury?CELINEWe were at this summer camp together and he was a swimmer.  He had that bleached-out, chlorine hair and green eyes, and to improve his times, he\u2019d shave the hair off his legs and arms.  So he was like this gorgeous dolphin.  My friend Emma had a big crush on him, and one day I was cutting across the field on my way back to my room, he came walking up beside me.  I told him he should ask Emma out because she had a big crush on him, and he said, \u201cThat\u2019s too bad, because I have a big crush on you.\u201d  And it really scared the hell out of me because I thought he was so fine.  He officially asked me out on a date but I pretended that I didn\u2019t like him because I was afraid of what I might do.  But I went to a swim competition and watched him swimming around.  He was so sexy.  At the end of the summer we sort of wrote these little declarations of love to each other and said we would keep writing and for sure meet again soon. JESSEDid you?CELINEOf course not. JESSEI think then this is the appropriate time to tell you I happen to be an excellent swimmer.CELINEOkay, I\u2019ll make a note, but it\u2019s my turn to ask a question.  Have you ever been in love?He thinks for a bit and then starts in. JESSEYes.  Okay, next question.  What do you think is you --22.CELINEWait a minute.  We can give on-word answers?JESSEWhy not?CELINEAfter I went into such detail about my first sexual feelings?JESSEBut there\u2019s a big difference between those two things.  I could tell you all about my first sexual feelings, no big deal.  What if I asked you about love?CELINEI would have lied, but at least I would\u2019ve made a great story. JESSESee.  The whole concept of love is much more complex.  Love\u2019s like God or something: It\u2019s everywhere...I see it, I feel it, but I don\u2019t know if another person is going to hand it to me. CELINEUnfortunately, I know what you mean. JESSEFor what it\u2019s worth, my first sexual feelings were experienced through an obsessive relationship with Miss July, 1978.  You know Playboy?CELINEYes.JESSEOkay, name something that really pisses you off.CELINEOh, gosh, everything pisses me off. JESSELike what?23.CELINEI hate being told by strange men to smile, just to make them feel better about their stupid lives.  I hate that three hundred kilometers away a war is going on.  People are dying.  And nobody knows what to do about it.  I hate how the media tries to control our minds.  It\u2019s a new form of very subtle fascism.  And I hate in a foreign country each time I wear black or lose my temper or express an opinion about anything, everyone always goes: \u201cOh, it\u2019s so French, it\u2019s so cute.\u201d  Oh, I hate that. They both laugh a bit at her becoming riled up so quickly.  She calms down and asks him a question. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)It\u2019s my turn now.  So what\u2019s a problem for you?JESSEYou, probably.CELINEHuh?JESSENo, really, I had a thought about a week ago that\u2019s kind of a problem. CELINEWhat is it?JESSEDo you believe in reincarnation?CELINEOn some level it\u2019s interesting.JESSEYeah.  It seems like a lot of people are talking about past lives and all that.  And even if you don\u2019t believe in that in a specific way, most people have some notion of an eternal soul, right?  Anyway, my thought was, if we all have our origins at the beginning of human history in some way, where did all the current souls come from?  24.\n(MORE)The earth\u2019s population fifty thousand years ago was not even a million people.  Ten thousand years ago, it was only a few million.  Now, the earth\u2019s population is between five and six billion.  That\u2019s about a five-thousand-to-one split of each soul in just the last fifty thousand years, which is just a blip in the earth\u2019s time.  At best, we\u2019re just a tiny fraction of a soul.  Is that why we all feel so scattered?CELINESo, that\u2019s a problem?JESSEI know, it\u2019s kind of a scattered thought, which is all the more reason it makes sense. INT. RECORD STORE - DAY 1313They enter the old, vinyl-only store and start to browse.JESSEIs that a listening booth over there?CELINEYes, I think so. They keep looking through albums.  She eventually finds an album and holds it up to him. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)Have you ever heard of this singer?JESSE(reading)No.CELINEI think she\u2019s American.  I have this friend in LA who told me about her.  I\u2019ve never been able to find any of her stuff.  I think it\u2019s kind of folksy, lyrical stuff. Jesse points across the store. 25.JESSE (CONT'D)JESSELets\u2019 see if that listening booth works. CELINELet\u2019s try it. They walk over to the booth and enter.  She takes the album out and puts it on the turntable.  As the music starts they both kind of lean against opposite walls in the small glass booth and concentrate on the song. SONGThere\u2019s a wind that blows in from the northAnd it says that loving takes its course Come here, come hereNo, I\u2019m not impossible to touchI have never wanted you so muchCome here.  Come here...They glance subtly up at each other but usually not when the other is looking.  The song makes both of them a little nervous as it brings out a shyness about the uncertainty of their relationship at that point. INT. SUBWAY - DAY 1414They ride on a subway as it breaks out of a tunnel into sunlight. EXT. NAMELESS CEMETERY - DAY1515They walk down the steps toward the small cemetery.  A rabbit runs past them. CELINEI visited this as a young teenager.  It left a bigger impression on me at that time than any of the museums we went to. JESSEIt\u2019s small. Inside, they wander around looking at the mostly identical crosses. 26.CELINEYes.  There was this little old man who talked to us.  He was the groundskeeper.  Almost everyone buried here washed up on the bank where the Danube curves away.JESSEHow old are these?CELINEAround the beginning of the century or so.  It\u2019s called Cemetery of the No Name because they often didn\u2019t really know who these people were.  Maybe a first name. JESSEWhy were there so many bodies washing up on the banks of the Danube?CELINEI think some were from accidents on boats and things like that, but most of them were suicides that jumped in the river.(a beat)I always liked the idea of all these unknown people, lost in the world.  When I was young I always thought that if none of your family or friends knew you were dead, then it\u2019s like not really being dead.  People can invent the best or the worst for you.She stops by one grave. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)Oh, here she is.  This is the one I remember the most.  She was thirteen when she died.  That meant something to me because I was that age when I saw this.  Now I\u2019m ten years older and she\u2019s still...thirteen, I guess. EXT. TRAM STATION - DUSK1616Montage shot of them riding on the tram at dusk.27.EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - SUNSET 1717They are in the huge old Ferris wheel in the Prater amusement park.  They have a large box to themselves and walk around in it looking at the various views. CELINEWhen I\u2019m up above everyone like this, I always think like the entire human race is this body, and we\u2019re all cells in the body.  It\u2019s an amazing, exquisite mess, no?JESSEYeah...(a beat)I want to change the subject for a second.  This could be an important moment.  I don\u2019t know if you noticed, but we\u2019re alone in this car.  The sun is going down...(a beat)Before the night is over, is it safe to assume that we\u2019re going to kiss?CELINEMaybe.JESSEMaybe?CELINEProbably. JESSEProbably.  Then I propose we jump in time to that moment when we would naturally do that - probably a couple of hours from now after a certain amount of awkwardness and stuff - and bring that moment back to here and now, given these ideal surroundings.  It\u2019ll be a great way to remember not only our first kiss, but this great sunset, the Ferris wheel, Vienna...Celine walks over to him and puts her arms around his neck. CELINEHow come every time you want me to do something, you start talking about time travel?28.JESSEOkay, I think we should kiss right now. They begin kissing and the Ferris wheel keeps moving. EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT 1818Walking along, they are in mid-conversation.CELINEBut I don\u2019t think it matters what generation you\u2019re born into.  Look at my parents.  They were these angry young May \u201868 people revolting against everything - the government, their conservative Catholic backgrounds.  I was born not long after and my dad went on to become this successful architect and we began to travel all over the world and I was raised with all the freedoms they had fought for.  And yet for me now, it\u2019s another type of fight.  We still have to deal with all the same shit.  But you can\u2019t really know what or who the enemy is. JESSEI don\u2019t know if there is an enemy.  Everyone\u2019s parents fucked them up.  They either left them or stuck around and taught them the wrong stuff.  Rich kids\u2019 parents give them too much, poor kids\u2019 not enough.  You either get too much attention or not enough.  My parents are just these two people who didn\u2019t like each other very much who got married and had a kid.  And they tried to be nice to me. CELINEDid your parents divorce?JESSEYeah, finally.  They should have done it earlier, but they stuck together for the well-being of my sister and me.  Thanks.(a beat)29.\n(MORE)You know, my mom once told me, right in front of my father when they were in this big fight, that he was really, really pissed off when he found out she was pregnant with me - that I was this big mistake.  Looking back on it, I think that shaped the way I think.  I saw the world as this place I wasn\u2019t really meant to be and had the people who created me had more control of the situation, I wouldn\u2019t exist. CELINEBut that\u2019s so sad.JESSEI think I eventually found a comfort in that.  Like my life was my own doing or something. CELINEMy parents are still together and I think they\u2019re happy.  But I think it\u2019s a healthy process to rebel against your parents and everything that came before.  In a certain way, more than rebelling, it\u2019s to have the feeling that we\u2019re finding a new way to deal with love, sex, society, everything.  We should always have to reinvent and make it our own. They walk in silence, just taking in all around them for a few moments.  A couple walks by, but both are completely in their own worlds. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)I\u2019ve been wondering lately...do you know anyone who\u2019s in a happy relationship?JESSEYeah, I know happy couples, but it seems like they have to lie to each other. CELINEPeople can live their whole life as a lie.  30.JESSE (CONT'D)\n(MORE)My grandmother was married to this man, and I always thought she had a very simple, uncomplicated love life.  But she just confessed to me that she spent her life dreaming about another man she was always in love with.  She just accepted her fate.  I was so sad.  But I also found it very beautiful that she had all those emotions I never thought she would have had.JESSEI guarantee you that it was better that way.  Had she got to know him, he would have disappointed her eventually. CELINEHow do you know?  You don\u2019t know who they are.JESSEI know.  It\u2019s just people have all these romantic projections. CELINEWhat do you mean, Mr. Romantic up in the Ferris wheel kiss me now as the sun is going down...?JESSE(interrupting)All right, all right.  What about your grandmother?  Finish your thought.CELINEIt just amazed me that I\u2019ve spent over twenty years of my life around her and I didn\u2019t know her. JESSEYou know her, but no one really knows anyone.  That\u2019s the thing about relationships - people are always saying, \u201cI want to know you, I want to know who you are.\u201d  But it is so hard for anyone to even know themselves.  Who I am is always changing, so how can anyone else share in that?31.CELINE (CONT'D)CELINESo that\u2019s it?  It\u2019s been nice not knowing you. They look over and see several elderly couples riding the bumper cars. EXT. KLEINES CAF\u00c9 - NIGHT1919They are sitting at a table in a sparsely populated outdoor caf\u00e9.  Jesse looks around briefly and then suddenly leans over and kisses a slightly surprised Celine. JESSEI just wanted to kiss you again. Celine sort of smiles and shrugs her shoulders when a ROSE PEDDLER suddenly approaches them.  She is an older gypsy-looking woman and holds up her bunch of roses toward Jesse.ROSE PEDDLER(in German)You buy a rose for the young lady?Jesse smiles and digs in his pocket.JESSESure, how many schillings?ROSE PEDDLERTwenty.As Jesse hands her the coins and she gives him the rose, she suddenly turns all her attention to Celine.  She impulsively grabs her hand and intensely starts looking at her palm.ROSE PEDDLER (CONT\u2019D)You want your palm read?CELINESure.Celine looks over at Jesse, who rolls his eyes, feeling a little invaded.  She flashes him a \u201cI want to do this, don\u2019t spoil it\u201d look.ROSE PEDDLERHmmm.  Uhh-huuh.  So you have been on a journey and you are a stranger to this place.  You are an adventurer...a seeker...and adventurer in your mind. 32.Celine is engrossed and occasionally nods.ROSE PEDDLER (CONT\u2019D)You are interested in the power of the woman.  In a woman\u2019s deep strength and creativity.  You are becoming this woman.(a beat)You need to resign yourself to the awkwardness of life.  Only if you find peace within yourself will you find true connections with others.The rose peddler looks up at Jesse and gestures to him.ROSE PEDDLER (CONT\u2019D)This is a stranger to you, yes?CELINEWell, yeah, I guess.The rose peddler authoritatively reaches for Jesse\u2019s hand, which he awkwardly offers up.  She examines his hand thoroughly, flips it over, examines his thumb, and lets him take it back.ROSE PEDDLER(to Celine)You\u2019ll be alright(a beat)He is learning. (a beat)Okay?CELINEThank you.  That was good. Celine gets up and hands the woman several coins.  As she walks away, the older lady adds one last bit.  ROSE PEDDLERYou are both stars, don\u2019t forget.  When the stars exploded billions of years ago, they formed everything that is this world.  The moon, the trees, everything we know is stardust.  So don\u2019t forget.  You are stardust.  They walk away, and Celine is filled with the experience but Jesse looks a little annoyed.  The more he builds up to a rant, the more amused she seems to get. 33.JESSEThat\u2019s all nice and everything, we are stardust and all that, and you are becoming this great woman, but I hope you don\u2019t think that\u2019s much different than reading your horoscope in some syndicated daily paper. CELINEWell, she knew I was on vacation and that we didn\u2019t know each other and that I was going to become this great woman. JESSE(interrupting)And what was that \u201cI am learning\u201d bullshit?  That\u2019s waaay condescending - she wasn\u2019t even doing me, and I even bought that fucking rose from her. (starting rant)If opportunists like that would ever tell the real truth, it would put their asses out of business.(new thought)Just once I want to see some old lady save up her money, and just as she\u2019s about to hear all this great stuff, the fortune teller would say, (wide-eyed stare)\u201cTomorrow and all your remaining days will be a lot like today, a tedious collection of hours.  You will have no new passions, travels, or thoughts.  When you die you will be forgotten.  Two hundred schillings, please.\u201d  That I\u2019d like to see. Celine plays with him. CELINESo it\u2019s funny how she almost didn\u2019t notice you.  I loved what she said. JESSEOf course you do.  You pay your money, you get to hear something that makes you feel good.  34.\n(MORE)Hey, maybe there\u2019s some seedy section of Vienna where you can buy a hit of crack. Celine continues to laugh at him.EXT. STREET - NIGHT2020As they are walking, Celine notices a poster for an upcoming exhibit of Seurat\u2019s drawings.CELINEOh, man, this doesn\u2019t start until next week - we\u2019ll miss it. She motions to one of the drawings on the poster. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)I actually saw this one at a museum a few years ago.  I just stared and stared at it - must have been forty-five minutes.  JESSECool.CELINEI love the way the people seem to be dissolving into the background.  It\u2019s like the environments are stronger than the people.  His human figures always seem so transitory.EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT2121As they walk down the street, they wander up the steps to a large cathedral.  They check to see if the door is open.  It is, and they go inside. INT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT2222They enter to find it completely empty but with hundreds of candles still burning.  In the background we hear the sound of the organ being tuned. JESSEToo bad it isn\u2019t daytime so we could see the stained glass windows better. 35.JESSE (CONT'D)CELINEI was in an old church like this one with my grandmother in Budapest a few days ago.  Even though I reject most of the religious thing, I can\u2019t help but feeling for all those people that come here lost, or in pain, guilt - who come here looking for answers.  It fascinates me how a single place can join so much pain and happiness, for so many generations. JESSESo you\u2019re pretty close to your grandmother.CELINEYes, I think so.  I think it\u2019s because I\u2019ve always had this feeling that I\u2019m this very old woman, laying down, about to die, and her last thoughts are the remembrance of her youth and her life.  I feel like my life is just her memories or something. JESSEThat\u2019s wild.  I always feel like I\u2019m still this thirteen-year-old boy who doesn\u2019t really know how to be an adult.  So it\u2019s like I\u2019m pretending to live a life, taking notes for when I\u2019ll really have to do it.  Kind of like a dress rehearsal for a junior high play.CELINEThat\u2019s funny.  So up there in the Ferris wheel it was this very old woman kissing this very young boy.JESSEGet your head out of the gutter.(new thought)Do you know anything about the Quakers?CELINENo, not much.36.JESSEIt\u2019s really cool.  I went to this Quaker wedding once, and do you know how they do it?  The couple kneels down in the middle of the church in front of everyone, and they stare at each other.  Nobody speaks unless God moves them to say something - a blessing, a warning, nothing, whatever.  And then after an hour of staring into each other\u2019s eyes, they\u2019re married. CELINEThat\u2019s beautiful.  I like that.They stare at each other for an extended moment.  He suddenly has a new thought and smiles. JESSEGosh, this is kind of a horrible story, but maybe this is an appropriate place to tell it.  I was driving around with this buddy of mine who\u2019s this big atheist, and we came to a stop where there was this homeless guy holding up a sign saying he needed a job or something.  My friend holds out a hundred-dollar bill to him and asks, \u201cDo you believe in God?\u201d  The guy looks at him, looks at the money, and says, \u201cYes, I do.\u201d  My friend goes, \u201cWrong answer,\u201d and drives away.CELINEThat\u2019s so mean. EXT. OUTDOOR CAF\u00c9 - NIGHT2323As the rain falls, they run for cover, finding a seat under a huge umbrella in an outdoor caf\u00e9.EXT. STREET - NIGHT2424They walk along. JESSEWould you be in Paris yet if you hadn\u2019t gotten off the train?37.CELINENo, not yet.  And what would you be doing?JESSEI don\u2019t know - hanging out at the airport, reading old magazines, crying in my coffee because you wouldn\u2019t get off the train with me. CELINEAhh...She gives him a little kiss. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)Actually, I\u2019d probably have gotten off the train in Salzburg with someone else. JESSEYeah, yeah.  I\u2019m just that American decorating your blank canvas.CELINENo, no.  I\u2019m having a great time. JESSEReally?  Me too. CELINEI\u2019m glad.  I love this because no one knows I\u2019m here and I don\u2019t know anyone that knows you that would tell me all the bad things you\u2019ve done. JESSEI can tell you some.CELINEI\u2019m sure.  You hear so much shit about people.  When I start dating a guy, I always feel like a general in the army - you know, plotting my strategy and maneuverings, knowing his weak points, what would hurt him, seduce him...(a beat)But if we were around each other all the time, what would be the first thing about me that would drive you crazy?38.JESSEI don\u2019t want to answer that.  I dated this girl once who used to always ask me that.  Finally, I told her that I thought that she didn\u2019t handle criticism very well.  Then she flew into a rage and broke up with me.  But I think she really just wanted the chance to say what she thought was wrong with me.  So just tell me what it is about me that bugs you. CELINENo, there\u2019s nothing.JESSETell me.  C\u2019mon, what?CELINEI can\u2019t think of anything.JESSEI\u2019m demanding you say something. CELINEActually, if I think about it, I didn\u2019t like this kind of behavior back at the palm reader.  You were like this little rooster prick. JESSERooster prick?  What the hell is that?CELINEYes, you were like this little child whining because all the attention wasn\u2019t focused on him. JESSEWhat are you talking about?  This woman robs you blind...CELINEYou were acting like a little boy walking by an ice cream shop, crying because his mother wouldn\u2019t buy him a milk shake or something.JESSEWait a second.  I didn\u2019t care what this flower-peddling charlatan had to say about anything.39.A man, the HOMELESS POET, approaches them. HOMELESS POET(in German)I\u2019d like to ask you something. CELINEUh, I speak okay, but he doesn\u2019t at all. HOMELESS POET(in English)Okay, then.  I\u2019d like to make a deal with you guys.  Instead of just asking for money, I\u2019ll ask you for a word.  I will then write a poem in which that word will be used.  I\u2019ll write it in English.  If you like it, if you feel it adds something to your life in any way, then you can pay me whatever you feel like. CELINE AND JESSEOkay, it\u2019s a deal.HOMELESS POETPick a word.JESSEUhh...(to Celine)What word?CELINEMilk shake.Jesse flashes her a look. JESSEI was going to say \u201crooster prick.\u201d  But perfect, of course, milk shake. The poet walks off a ways and starts writing. CELINEI like what he said about adding something to your life.JESSEI know.  Hey, were we just arguing back there?40.CELINENo, no...JESSEYeah, I think we were. CELINEEven if we were, why does everyone think conflict is so bad?  Good things can come out of conflict. JESSEI guess so.  I think if I could just accept the fact that life is supposed to be difficult, and that\u2019s what\u2019s to be expected, then I wouldn\u2019t get so pissed off about it.  I\u2019d just be happy when something nice happened. CELINEI think That\u2019s why I\u2019m still in school.  It\u2019s easier to have something to fight against. JESSEAnd we\u2019ve all had this competitiveness drilled into us.(thinking)I mean, I can be doing the most nothing thing - shooting pool or playing darts socially - and I\u2019ll feel it come over me: I want to win, I want to do the best I can, and my standards suddenly shift to just beyond my abilities.  I can hear every coach or male teacher or boss I ever had.  \u201cJesse, you\u2019re not trying hard enough!  Get your head out of your ass!  Hustle up!\u201dCELINEIs that why you tried to get me off the train?  Competitiveness?JESSEWhat do you mean?CELINETo make sure the guy behind you didn\u2019t pick me up?  Where you competing with him?41.JESSEWhat guy?CELINEThat really cute, big, strong, Italian-looking guy two seats behind you that was smiling at me the whole time. JESSEHe\u2019s better-looking than me?The homeless poet returns with a small piece of paper. CELINE(to Jesse)C\u2019est la vie. HOMELESS POETI have your poem.CELINEWill you read it to us?HOMELESS POETSure.(reads poem)Daydream delusionlimousine eyelashOh baby with your pretty facedrop a tear in my wineglassLook at those big eyes on your facesee what you mean to meSweet cakes and milk shakesI\u2019m a delusion angel  I\u2019m a fantasy paradeI want you to know what I thinkdon\u2019t want you to guess anymoreYou have no idea where I came from we have no idea where we\u2019re going       Lodged in life like branches in a river  flowing downstreamcaught in the currentI\u2019ll carry you you carry me that\u2019s how it could be  don\u2019t you know me  don\u2019t you know me by nowThey are both silent. 42.CELINEWow...They give him some money.JESSEThanks, man.  Good luck.CELINEIt\u2019s beautiful, no?JESSEYeah, that was beautiful.  You know, he didn\u2019t just write that poem...I\u2019m not saying he didn\u2019t write that poem.  He just didn\u2019t write it tonight.  He just plugged in that milk shake. CELINEWhat do you mean?JESSENothing.  It\u2019s a nice poem.They walk away. EXT. STREET - NIGHT2525They continue walking along.CELINEI want to ask you something.  Do you consider me detached?JESSEDetached from what?CELINESomeone once called me this detached intellectual.  I\u2019m afraid I am like that.  I comment too much on thing and maybe don\u2019t feel close enough to anything. JESSEI don\u2019t feel that way about you at all. Whoever said that is an asshole.43.CELINENo, but it\u2019s my biggest fear.  To be one of those people with that sort of academic, liberal, detached view of everything.  That whole attitude has nothing to do with really living. JESSEWho\u2019s to say what\u2019s really living?CELINEWell, I wonder.  That\u2019s the big question, no?  I think it\u2019s either a life experienced or a life examined.  But life examined is life experienced.(a beat)Maybe if I had none of these stupid artistic pretensions at all, I would be looking at the world differently. JESSEI know what you mean. CELINEWhat\u2019s that Thomas Mann quote?  \u201cI would rather participate in life than write a hundred stories.\u201dJESSEHmmm, I like that. (a beat)I knew this guy once, this kind of nerdy goth-rock guy.  And he was crossing the street one day, and he got hit by a car.  We all went to see him in the hospital, and he was going to be okay and everything, but he told us that his strongest sensation from the accident was the joy he felt when he realized that finally something was actually happening to him. They both laugh. CELINEYeah, it\u2019s like seeing yourself from a third-person perspective.  I always feel like I\u2019m observing my life instead of living it.  44.\n(MORE)At my grandfather\u2019s funeral, even though I loved him, it seemed everyone else was mourning and I was too busy observing them; each of them was like a paragraph of a book I might write someday, describing every emotion in detail.JESSEI know.  I remember when I was younger listening to my parents fight and feeling like I was in an after-school special on TV.  Thinking I should act moody, or depressed.  I should steal some cigarettes and sunglasses, get caught, and then blame it on the fact that I come from a troubled home. CELINEYeah, I think I\u2019m always so much more happy with books and movies and stuff.  I think I get more excited about well-done representations of life than life itself. EXT. HOT DOG STAND - NIGHT 2626They walk up to Viennese hot dog stand and order something to drink.  They notice some of the interesting characters hanging around, including the man behind the corner.INT. CAF\u00c9 - NIGHT2727They enter an interesting old caf\u00e9.  Celine goes to the bathroom while Jesse waits.  Separated from her for the first time, he stands around a bit awkwardly, observing posters and the goings-on in the caf\u00e9.  She eventually returns and they exit the caf\u00e9.EXT. ARENA CLUB - NIGHT2828They walk in front of a bar/club from which there is music coming out. JESSEYou want to go in?45.CELINE (CONT'D)CELINEYeah.  Is there a cover?JESSEIt\u2019s cheap.  I\u2019ll pay.CELINEDon\u2019t worry about it.  I\u2019ve got some cash. INT. ARENA CLUB - NIGHT 2929A SINGER with a guitar is onstage finishing up a weird but humorous song.  He finishes and gets up to leave. SINGER(in German)Hey, um, stick around.  I think Liz is going to show her latest film and provide some verbal accompaniment. A projector is set up to show against the back wall of the stage.  The filmmaker, LIZ, takes the microphone and sits on the stage facing the screen.  She has a piece of paper in her hand and signals for the projectionist to start.  The room darkens and the film begins.  Behind the first black-and-white Super 8 images is the title scratched in white, in German: A KIND OF NOISE AND A KIND OF SILENCE.  The film consists of images of fairly recent (1985-1994) events, bands playing, catastrophes, televised images.  Interspersed throughout is an eerie series of images of solitary individuals, some looking at the camera, some away.  The film evokes a melancholy and almost romantic loneliness.  She speaks in German and we read subtitles. LIZOur critique began, as all critiques begin, with doubt...doubt became our life.  Ours was a quest for a new story, our own, and we grasped toward this new history, driven by the Dada suspicion that ordinary language could not tell it.(a beat)Our past appeared frozen in the distance and our every gesture and accent bespoke the negation of an old world and the reach for a new one.(a beat)46.\n(MORE)The discovery of a true communication was what it was about - or at least the quest for such a communication, the adventure of finding it and losing it...we continued looking, the unappeased and the unaccepting, beneath, outside, dispersed, communicating only by a passing glance but still knowing that no matter how empty the world seemed, no matter how degraded and used up the world appeared to be, anything was still possible. Scratched on the film for a closing credit: TO BEGIN AGAIN, FROM THE BEGINNING.INT. BAR INSIDE THE ARENA COMPOUND - NIGHT3030They are taking turns playing pinball. JESSESo, we haven\u2019t even talked about this, but, uh, are you dating anyone?  You got a boyfriend waiting for you in Paris or anything like that?CELINENo, no, not right now...JESSEYou did?CELINEWe broke up over six months ago.JESSEI\u2019m sorry.  I mean, I\u2019m not that sorry, but, uh, tell me about it. CELINENo, no, it\u2019s boring.  I can\u2019tJESSEC\u2019mon, c\u2019mon.CELINEI was really disappointed.  I thought this one would last a while.  47.LIZ (CONT'D)\n(MORE)He was very stupid, ugly, bad in bed, alcoholic - I was kind of giving him a favor.  But he left me saying I loved him too much and because I was blocking his artistic expression.  I was traumatized and became totally obsessed with him.  I went to see a shrink and it came up that I had written these little stories about how I was going to kill him - all the intricate details about how I would do it and not get caught. JESSEKill him?She realizes Jesse is looking at her a bit strangely. CELINEOh no, it\u2019s nothing I would ever do, I think it was just some writing. JESSEI understand.CELINEAnyway, but this stupid shrink believed everything I was telling her.  She said she had to call the police.  She was totally convinced I was really going to do it even though I told her it was just my way of dealing with it.  She said, looking deep into my eyes, \u201cThe way you said it, I know you are going to do it.\u201d  That was my first and last session.  I totally got over him, but now I\u2019m obsessed that he\u2019s going to die from an accident, maybe a thousand kilometers away, and I will be accused. Jesse just smiles.  They change positions and she begins playing.CELINE (CONT\u2019D)Why is it you become obsessed with the people you don\u2019t really care for?(a beat)So, what about you?  Are you with anyone?48.CELINE (CONT'D)JESSEFunny, how we avoided this question for so long.CELINEI know, but now you have to tell me. JESSEI don\u2019t know.  Love is like this escape for people who haven\u2019t learned to be alone or to make something of themselves.  People think love is this unselfish or totally giving thing.  But if you think about it, there\u2019s probably nothing more selfish. CELINESo who just broke up with you?JESSEWhat?CELINESounds like you just got hurt.JESSEOkay...big confession.(a beat)Actually, I\u2019ll tell you something.  I didn\u2019t just come to Europe to find myself and read Hemingway in Paris and shit like that.  I worked all spring saving up money to fly to Madrid to spend the summer with my girlfriend, who\u2019s been on this asinine art history program for the last year.  But I got over here, and on our first night, reunited at long last, we went out to dinner, with five of her friends: Gonzalo, Pedro, Maria, Antonio, Suzie from home.  She pretty much avoided being alone with me the first couple of days I was there, but I stuck around awhile just to let it sink in that she wished I hadn\u2019t come.  So I got the cheapest charter flight out of Europe, this one leaving out of Vienna tomorrow, but I had a couple of weeks to kill, so I bought a Eurail pass. (a beat)49.\n(MORE)You know what the worst thing about someone breaking up with you is?  Remembering how little you really thought about the people you broke up with and realizing that\u2019s how little they\u2019re thinking about you.  You like to think you are both in so much pain, but really they\u2019re just relieved you\u2019re gone.  CELINEWell, you should look at bright colors. JESSEWhat?CELINEThat\u2019s what that shrink told me.  I was paying nine hundred francs an hour to hear that I was a homicidal maniac but I could perhaps shift my obsession if I would concentrate on bright colors. JESSEDid it work?CELINEI haven\u2019t killed him yet. EXT. STREET - NIGHT3131Walking along, they are engaged in an upbeat, lively debate.JESSEI mean, why is a man ultimately judged so harshly on the issue of fidelity?  You can be the best father and husband, you can be supportive and a great friend to your wife, but if you fuck around - uh-oh, we had it all wrong, you\u2019re really a loser.  I mean, there are these breeds of monkeys, and all they do is have sex all the time.  And they\u2019re the ones that are the most peaceful and the most happy.  What\u2019s so bad about fooling around?CELINEYou\u2019re talking about monkeys?50.JESSE (CONT'D)JESSEYeah.CELINESounds like a perfect male argument for justifying them fooling around.JESSEBut the women monkeys are fooling around too. CELINEYou know, I had this awful paranoid  thought that feminism was mostly invented by men so they could fuck around more.  Women, free your mind, free your body, sleep with me, we\u2019re all free and happy as long as I can fool around as much as I want...JESSEBut think about it.  If you had an island with ninety-nine women and one man, within a year you\u2019d have the possibility of ninety-nine babies.  If you had an island with ninety-nine men and one woman, after a year you\u2019d have the possibility of one baby. CELINEYes, and there\u2019d probably be only about forty-three men left because they would have killed each other.  And on the other island there would be ninety-nine women, ninety-nine babies, and no man because all the women would have gotten together and eaten him alive. JESSEThere\u2019s something to that, isn\u2019t there?  I think women don\u2019t mind killing men on some level.  Like, I was walking down the street once with my ex-girlfriend, and we pass these four thuggy guys leaning on a Camaro, and sure enough, one says, \u201cHey babe, nice ass.\u201d  I keep walking and I think, okay, have your fun, is it that big a deal?  I don\u2019t do anything.  I let it slide...51.CELINEPlus there were four of them.JESSEExactly.  So a few steps later, she turns and says, \u201cFuck you, dickheads.\u201d  I\u2019m thinking, wait a minute, they aren\u2019t going to come over and kick her ass.  Who\u2019s just been pushed to the front of the line on this one?  See, women say they hate it when you get all territorial and protective, but when it suits them, they tell you you\u2019re being all unmanly and a wimp.CELINEBut I don\u2019t think women want to kill men, and if they do, they rarely succeed.  I\u2019m sure men kill more women.  Anyway, this is depressing.  You know what? JESSELet\u2019s stop talking about this. CELINEYeah.  When you start talking about women and men, there\u2019s no end. JESSEI know - it\u2019s a skipping record.  People have been trying to figure it out for millenniums.  Every artist has tried their hand at it...CELINEAnd no one\u2019s come up with anything.INT. CAF\u00c9 - NIGHT3232After a series of tables of interesting people and hearing bits of conversations, we see Celine and Jesse sitting across from each other, talking for once. CELINEOkay.  Now I\u2019m calling my best friend in Paris, who I\u2019m supposed to have lunch with in about eight hours.  Drrr!  Drrr!  Ring!  Ring!    Pick up.52.JESSEWhat?CELINEPick up the phone. JESSEOh, right.  Hello?CELINEAllo, Vani.  C\u2019est Celine.  Comment \u00e7a va? JESSEBien, et toi?CELINEOh, tu sais ce qui n\u2019est arriv\u00e9... JESSEOkay, maybe we should do it in English.CELINEVanessa.  I\u2019m sorry I missed lunch, but I met a guy on the train and got off with him in Vienna.  We\u2019re still here. JESSEAre you crazy?CELINEProbably. JESSESo he\u2019s Austrian?  He lives there?CELINENo, no, he\u2019s just passing through here too.  He\u2019s American.  He goes home tomorrow morning.JESSESo why\u2019d you get off the train with him? CELINEHe convinced me, but I think I was ready after only talking to him a short while.  He was so sweet.  53.\n(MORE)We were in the lounge car and he began to talk about him as a little boy seeing his great-grandmother\u2019s ghost.  I think that\u2019s when I feel for him - just the idea of this little boy, full of dreams.  He trapped me. JESSEHmmm.CELINEAnd he\u2019s so cute.  He has really beautiful blue eyes, nice pink lips, and greasy hair.  He\u2019s kinda tall and a little clumsy.  I like to feel his eyes on me when I look away.  And he kind of kisses like an adolescent.  It\u2019s so cute. JESSEWhat?CELINEYeah, we kissed.  It was so adorable.  As the night went on I began to like him more and more.  But I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s scared of me.  I told him of my story about the woman killing her ex-boyfriend and stuff.  He must be thinking I\u2019m this manipulative, mean, dangerous woman.  I just hope he doesn\u2019t feel that way about me because - you know me - I\u2019m the most harmless person.  I just hide behind angriness because it\u2019s the only way I\u2019ve found to protect myself.  The only person I could ever really hurt is myself. JESSEI\u2019m sure he\u2019s not scared of you.  I\u2019m sure he\u2019s crazy about you. CELINEOkay, now it\u2019s your turn.  Call your friend. Jesse puts the phone up to his ear. JESSEBrrriiing.  I usually get this guy\u2019s answering machine. 54.CELINE (CONT'D)CELINEHey, dude, what\u2019s up?JESSEHey, Frank, you\u2019re there. CELINESo you\u2019re back?  How was Madrid?JESSEWell, it all pretty much sucked.  I\u2019m coming back a little early.  Jodie and I finally had our long overdue meltdown.  The long distance thing never seems to work, does it?  All my stupid, romantic projections.  Ugh.  I was actually only in Madrid a few days.  I had to get the hell out of there.  I\u2019ve been wandering around Europe for the last couple of weeks like an idiot.  I got a cheaper flight out of Vienna that didn\u2019t leave for a while, but it really wasn\u2019t that much cheaper.  I could have come right back, but I just couldn\u2019t.  I think I wanted to just wallow for a while.  I wanted to run, but not home.  I didn\u2019t want to see anyone I knew.  I didn\u2019t want to talk.  I wanted to be a ghost, completely anonymous. CELINEAre you okay?JESSEYeah, that\u2019s just it.  I\u2019m great...rapturous.  I\u2019m a real person again.  I\u2019ll tell you why.  It\u2019s my last night in Europe and I\u2019ve met someone very special.  You know how they say we are each other\u2019s angels and demons?  Well, she was literally this Botticelli angel, waiting for me at the gate back to life.CELINEWow...how did you meet?55.JESSEOn the train.  I actually saw her a couple of hours before we ever talked, as I was finding a seat.  She had her foot up on the seat across from her and didn\u2019t notice me at all as I passed by her.  Then later, there was this weirdo couple fighting near her, and she moved back and happened to sit right across the aisle from me.  We began to talk.  I don\u2019t think she really liked me at the beginning.  She is so smart and passionate and beautiful - I felt so unsure of myself.  I felt everything I was saying was stupid macho stuff. CELINEOh, man, I wouldn\u2019t worry.  I\u2019m sure she was not judging you.  And by the way, she decided to sit next to you.  I\u2019m sure she did it on purpose.  Us men are stupid.  We never understand women.  They act strange, the little I know of them. EXT. ALBERTINA LEDGE - NIGHT3333Celine and Jesse sit on the steps of a statue and observe the fairly constant activity around them.  A serious-looking guy walks by carrying a bag. JESSESee that guy?  We\u2019ll never see him again.  That was the one moment our lives intersect. The guy suddenly turns and walks back the other way. CELINEI always wonder about things like that.  Like, think of the bag he is carrying.  I wonder what is in it.  If you think he\u2019s carrying a bomb to blow up the opera because he failed his audition for Don Juan, then his serious expression becomes this angry, vicious face.  56.\n(MORE)But if you imagine in his bag is a present for his young, dying wife, then he becomes this poor, sympathetic character who you want to give a big hug to. JESSEHmmm.Celine indicates a young art-student-looking woman. CELINEShe\u2019s thinking about a TV show she saw yesterday on strippers, and even though all her friends were disgusted by it, she\u2019s thinking about giving up her low-paying office job and giving it a try. A nerdy guy walks by. JESSEThat guy over there...rejected by Scientology.  Actually flunked his free personality test - they had no use for him. EXT. ALBERTINA LEDGE - NIGHT3434They sit on the ledge overlooking the lit-up opera house.JESSEI feel like this is some dream world we\u2019re walking through. CELINEIt\u2019s so weird.  It\u2019s like our time together is just ours - it\u2019s our own creation.  It\u2019s like, I\u2019m in your dream and you\u2019re in mine. JESSEYeah, what we\u2019re doing this whole night shouldn\u2019t officially be happening. CELINEMaybe that\u2019s why this feels so other-worldly.(a beat)But then, the morning comes and we turn into pumpkins. 57.CELINE (CONT'D)JESSEAhh.  I don\u2019t want to talk about the morning. CELINEBut at this point I think you\u2019re supposed to produce the glass slipper and see if it fits. They both laugh. EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 3535They are on a large docked boat, the Johann Strauss, that serves as a restaurant.  They are sitting at a quiet outdoor table on the bow of the boat. JESSEAnd this older friend of mine said, at the birth of his child - it was a home birth and he was there helping out and everything - at that profound moment of birth, all he could think about was death.  That he was seeing something experience life for the first time, struggling for breath, and knowing that it was going to die someday.  He couldn\u2019t get it out of his head. CELINEI think that\u2019s why life is so interesting - because it\u2019s going to end. JESSEI know.  Death ups the ante being alive. CELINEIt\u2019s the same for us tonight, though.  If we knew we were going to see each other next week, it would not be the same energy, no?JESSEYeah, I know. CELINEDo you think we will see each other after tomorrow morning?58.JESSEI don\u2019t know.  What do you think?CELINEI asked you.JESSEHmmm.  I\u2019m thinking how...I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be in Europe again anytime soon.  Are you coming to the U.S. For any reason?Celine puts her head down on the table, depressed.CELINEOh, God, I don\u2019t want to get into the practical side of how we\u2019d see each other again.  Flying.  Let\u2019s be rational adults about this. JESSEOkay, uh, rational. CELINEWe should try something different. (a beat)It\u2019s not so bad if tonight is our only night.  Maybe it makes it really special. JESSEYeah, usually you exchange numbers and call each other once, maybe write each other once or twice...CELINEAnd then the slow fizzle.JESSEI hate that.CELINEThere was this famous writer - I don\u2019t remember who - who said the ideal relationship was two intense years, with clean breaks, fresh starts, friends for life, something like that.  It\u2019s like if you knew your relationship had to end in two years, there would be no room for fighting or wasted time.  There could be more love and appreciation for one another.  59.\n(MORE)It\u2019s like, if everyone you met you knew was going to die at midnight, you would be a much more compassionate person.  I mean, everyone\u2019s going to die, but since no one knows when, there\u2019s all the time in the world to be assholes to one another.  JESSEWhy do we think that relationships are supposed to last forever anyway, and that anything less is a failure?(a beat)But I hate the thought that we\u2019re just these ships passing in the night.  I think the only time I get depressed is when I feel that life is just this series of momentary connections.  I mean, of all the people you\u2019ve ever known, how many of them are still in your life in any way?  What happened to all the people you grew up with?  Miss Van Sickle, my bus driver in first grade - what\u2019s she up to?  What kind of life is she having? A wandering violin player has entered the room and is playing a waltz.CELINEBut for some people, there are no real good-byes.  I think if you have a meaningful experience with someone else, a true communication, they are with you forever in a way.  We are all a part of each other in ways we\u2019ll never know. JESSESo it\u2019s a deal?  We\u2019ll die in the morning? CELINEI think it\u2019s the only way.  I don\u2019t want to cheapen what\u2019s special about our time together.  If we push for something more, it\u2019s like we\u2019re trying to commodify ourselves or something.60.CELINE (CONT'D)JESSEOkay, no delusions.  No projections.  Let\u2019s just make the rest of tonight great. CELINEAnd it\u2019ll be ours forever. JESSEWe should do some kind of special handshake or something.CELINEOkay.They do a sort of handshake and then watch the violin player.EXT. ACTIVE STREET - NIGHT3636Celine and Jesse walk down a fairly busy street near some nightclubs.  They come across a crowd gathered around a woman dancing, and the rhythmic sound of finger cymbals can be heard.  Sitting on the ground is a man playing a dumbek who beats out a mesmerizing rhythm.  Celine grabs Jesse\u2019s arm with a look of excitement and rushes toward the crowd, finding a good vantage point to watch the Middle Eastern dancer.  The dancer performs in an exciting and unusual way and elicits a positive reaction from the crowd.  At the end of the performance Celine places a couple of bills in the tambourine that sits on the sidewalk near the dancer\u2019s shoes.  Then she and Jesse proceed down the street as the crowd disperses.  Celine is obviously moved by the dance.  CELINEI saw a documentary on that stuff - It\u2019s a birth dance. JESSEA birth dance?  How does that work?CELINEWomen used it when giving birth.  In some parts of the world they still do it.  The woman in labor enters a tent and the women of her tribe surround her and dance using their torsos and pelvises, and they encourage the birthing woman to dance with them so as to make the birth less painful.  And after the baby is born, they all dance in celebration. 61.JESSEWow.  My mom would have never gone for that. CELINEBut it\u2019s a really primal dance.  They think that women have usually done it mainly for other women as some kind of fertility ritual.JESSEThat\u2019s cool.CELINEIt\u2019s a beautiful thing.  I like the idea of dance as being a common function of life, something that everyone participates in. JESSEI know.  I heard about this old man watching a bunch of young people dancing.  He said, \u201cHow beautiful.  They are trying to shake off their genitals and become angels.\u201d(a beat)But, uh, just one question back there.  When the women are being all spiritual and dancing for the gods and themselves and stuff, where are the men?  Out food gathering?  Just not allowed?  See, Y\u2019all don\u2019t need us?CELINEMen are lucky we don\u2019t bite off their heads after mating.  Certain insects do that, you know - spiders and stuff.  We, at least, let you live.  What are you complaining about?She laughs as he jumps on her words. JESSEYou\u2019re officially kidding, but you keep bringing that up.  There is something to that. CELINE(interrupting)No, no, no.  Okay, speaking seriously here.  62.\n(MORE)I mean, I feel this pressure to be a strong and independent icon of womanhood and not have it look like my life is only revolving around some guy, but the love of a man and returning that love means a lot to me.  I always make fun of it and stuff, but isn\u2019t everything we\u2019re doing in life a way to be loved a little more or something?JESSESometimes I dream of being a good father and a good husband.  Sometimes that feels really close, but other times it just seems silly, and that it would ruin my life.  It\u2019s not that I have a fear of commitment or I\u2019m incapable of loving or caring about someone else, because I can.  It\u2019s just that if I\u2019m totally honest with myself, I\u2019d rather die knowing that I was really good at something, that I was special or had excelled in some way, than to have only been in a really nice, caring relationship.CELINEYou know, I had worked for this older man, and once he told me that he had spent all his life thinking about his career and his work, and how he was fifty-two and it suddenly struck him that he had never really given anything of himself, that his life was for no one and nothing.  He was almost crying saying this.(a beat)I really believe that if there\u2019s any kind of god, he wouldn\u2019t be in any one of us - not you, not me - but just this space in between.  If there\u2019s some magic in this world, it must be in the attempt of understanding someone else, sharing something, even if it\u2019s almost impossible to succeed.  But who cares - the answer must be in the attempt. 63.CELINE (CONT'D)INT. DANCE CLUB - NIGHT3737They enter a small, almost desolate disco where on couple is dancing and a few others are sitting around - the up-all-night crowd.  They split up and he goes over to the BARTENDER and starts talking to him, pleading with him.  She goes over to an empty table and subtly takes two glasses.  Across the room, he\u2019s made a little headway with the gruff, older bartender, who eventually relents and hands him a bottle of wine.  Suddenly Lou Christie\u2019s \u201cLightnin\u2019 Strikes\u201d comes over the speakers and Jesse hams it up as he crosses the dance floor on his way back to meet her at the door.  He tries to get into it and has a little success. EXT. PARK - NIGHT3838Later, they are sitting in a remote area of the park, pouring glasses from their bottle of wine. CELINESo often in my life I\u2019ve been with people and shared beautiful moments like traveling or staying up all night and watching the sunrise, and I knew it was a special moment, but something was always wrong.  I wished I\u2019d been with someone else.  I knew that what I was feeling - exactly what was so important to me - they didn\u2019t understand.  But I\u2019m happy to be with you.  You couldn\u2019t possibly know why a night like this is so important to my life right now, but it is.  I think this is a great morning. JESSEIt is a great morning. (a beat)Do you think we\u2019d have other mornings like this?CELINEWhat about our vow?JESSEYeah, I know.(a beat)I\u2019ve had those same feelings of wishing someone wasn\u2019t there, but I think it\u2019s myself I\u2019d like to get away from. 64.She looks up at him. JESSE (CONT\u2019D)I\u2019ve never been anywhere I haven\u2019t been.  I\u2019ve never had a kiss when I wasn\u2019t one of the kissers.  I\u2019ve never been to the movies when I wasn\u2019t in the audience or gone out bowling when I wasn\u2019t around making some stupid joke. She smiles, not really taking him seriously.JESSE (CONT\u2019D)No, really, I think that\u2019s why so many people hate themselves.  I mean if we got married, after a few years, you\u2019d hate a lot of my mannerisms, the way I drink a little too much when I\u2019m insecure, the way I tell the same ridiculous, pseudo-intellectual ideas to every couple we have over to dinner.  But you see, I\u2019ve already heard all my stupid stories, so of course I\u2019m sick of myself.  But our time here has been completely out of time.  Being with you has made me feel like I am someone else.  I haven\u2019t had my past around to constantly drown me.  The only other way to lose yourself like this is with drugs, or alcohol, dancing...stuff like that. CELINEFucking...He just looks up at her, smiling, a little surprised.JESSEYeah, fucking.CELINEDo you know what I want?JESSEWhat?CELINETo be kisses.JESSEI can do that.65.He gets up and kisses her, and tries to take it a little further. CELINEI have to say something stupid.JESSESure.CELINEIt\u2019s very stupid.JESSEOkay.CELINEI don\u2019t think we should sleep together.  I want to, but since we\u2019re not going to see each other again, it\u2019ll make me feel bad.  I\u2019ll wonder who else you\u2019re with.  I\u2019ll miss you.  I know it\u2019s not very adult...maybe it\u2019s a female thing...I can\u2019t help it. JESSEOkay, we\u2019ll see each other again.CELINENo.  I don\u2019t want you to break our vow just so you can get laid. JESSEI don\u2019t want to just get laid.  I want to have sex with you.  We\u2019re going to die in the morning, right?  I think we should.CELINENo.  Then it\u2019s like some male fantasy - meet a French girl on a train, fuck her, never see her again, and have a great story to tell.  I don\u2019t want to be a great story.  I don\u2019t want our great evening to have just been for that. JESSEOkay, let\u2019s not have sex. CELINEYou don\u2019t want to see me again?66.JESSENo, of course I do.  I mean, fuck, if I was asked right now to marry you or never see you again, I would marry you.  I mean, maybe that\u2019s a lot of romantic crap.  But people have gotten married for a lot less.  I think we\u2019d have as good a chance as anyone else.  Do you want to sleep with me?CELINEWell, actually I already decided to sleep with you when I got off the train.  Now that we\u2019ve talked so much I don\u2019t know anymore.  Why do I make everything so complicated?JESSEI don\u2019t know.They begin making out as we see the first light in the sky.EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING 3939They are walking along slowly, awkwardly, each a little in their own world. JESSEWhat\u2019s the first thing you\u2019re going to do when you get back to Paris?CELINECall my parents.  What about you?JESSEI will go pick up my dog.  He\u2019s with a buddy of mine. CELINEAhh.  I love dogs.JESSEOh, shit - we\u2019re back in real time. CELINEIt\u2019s awful.  I can\u2019t stand it. For the last few moments we\u2019ve been hearing the sound of a harpsichord far in the distance.JESSEDo you hear that?67.CELINEYeah...What is that...a harpsichord?JESSELet\u2019s go see where the hell that\u2019s coming from. They walk toward the baroque sounds.  As they get closer, the music gets louder.  They finally pinpoint the source.  Through a small street-level window they see a guy in a basement room playing away at his harpsichord.  The HARPSICHORD PLAYER\u2019s entire room is decorated in a seventeenth-to eightenth-century fashion with wood-plank floors, old furniture, and paintings.  Together with the beautiful and intense music, it is a stunning view - a living portrait.  They sort of look at each other occasionally but say nothing.  Celine and Jesse both begin to feel awkward at their Peeping Tom status now that the music is over, and they walk off quietly.  Jesse takes her hand. JESSE (CONT\u2019D)Can you dance to a harpsichord?CELINEI don\u2019t know.  Maybe.They dance a little on the sidewalk.EXT. ALBERTINA LEDGE - EARLY MORNING 4040They sit with their heads back on a bench, staring up at the early-morning clouds.CELINEWhen you talked earlier about after a few years how a couple would begin to hate each other by anticipating their reactions or getting tired of their mannerisms, I think it would be the opposite with me.  I think I can fall in love when I know everything about him - how he\u2019s going to part his hair, or what shirt he\u2019s going to wear that day, knowing the exact story he would tell in a given situation.  I\u2019m sure that\u2019s when I\u2019d know I\u2019m really in love. Jesse just smiles, looks at her, and then slowly looks back up at the sky. 68.JESSE(silly voice)The years shall run like rabbits...CELINEWhat?JESSENothing.  I have this great recording of Dylan Thomas reading this W.H. Auden poem.  He has this great voice.  It was like...(silly voice)\u201cBut all the clocks in the cityBegan to whirr and chime:O let not Time deceive you, You cannot conquer Time...\u201cIn headaches and in worryVaguely life leaks away,And Time will have his fancyTo-morrow or to-day.\u201dEXT. TRAIN STATION - DAWN4141She has retrieved her bag from the locker, and they are walking along the train toward her car.  They seem vulnerable, even shy, as they both finally face the inevitable.CELINESo you know what bus you\u2019re taking to the airport?JESSEYeah, no problem.CELINEI guess this is it, no?JESSEYep.  I really...you know.CELINEI know.  Me too.(a beat)You lied to me, you know.JESSEWhat do you mean?69.CELINEYou told me that our time together would someday make me happier with my future husband, but now I\u2019ll wonder even more.Neither says anything for an extended moment.CELINE (CONT\u2019D)Be happy, okay?  Work hard and have fun with everything you\u2019re doing. JESSEI will.  And good luck with school and everything.(a beat)I hate this.CELINEI know.  I think the train is about to leave. They look into each other\u2019s eyes.  Jesse reaches out for Celine\u2019s hand and clasps it tightly.  They smile, knowing that they\u2019ve changed in unexpected ways, and then embrace tenderly for several moments.  They part, and Celine turns suddenly and walks up the stairs to her train car.  As she reaches the top step she hesitates, turns, and looks back and Jesse, who\u2019s still staring at her.  He signals for her to hold on a second.JESSEHey, everything we were saying is bullshit.  This is all stupid - I don\u2019t want to do it. She laughs.JESSE (CONT\u2019D)And I didn\u2019t lie to you.  I\u2019ll prove it. CELINEYeah?JESSEI\u2019ll come with you.Celine is almost laughing.CELINENo.  You\u2019ll drive me crazy.  You don\u2019t speak French.  I\u2019d have to completely take care of you.  70.\n(MORE)It would be a big mistake. (a beat)But perhaps we should meet in five years.JESSEYeah, think so?  Five years?CELINENo, no.  Five years is too long.  It would be more like a sociology experiment.  How about one year?JESSEYes, one year.  One year?  How about six months?CELINEBut it will be freezing.JESSEOkay, we can meet here and then go somewhere else.CELINEOkay.  But is that six months from now or last night?JESSELast night.  Okay.  Six months from last night.  December sixteenth, six o\u2019clock in the evening, track eleven.  It\u2019s a train ride for you, but I got to fly over.  But, hey, I\u2019ll be here. CELINEGood.  And we\u2019re not going to write or call or anything right?JESSERight.  But six months. They laugh at themselves and give a quick kiss before parting.CELINEGood-bye.JESSEBye.They part and Celine disappears into the train. 71.CELINE (CONT'D)INT/EXT. MORNING MONTAGE4242Celine finds her way to a seat.  Jesse gets his stuff out of his locker and begins walking.  As her train slowly pulls out of the station, we hear the harpsichord and see a series of shots of many of the locations Celine and Jesse inhabited the night before.  In the early-morning light these places are now somehow different.  Even though there is little human presence at this time of the morning, the transformation has begun.  We see Jesse getting situated on his bus to the airport.  We then see the park where they danced, sang, and stared up at the sky.  A very old lady walks slowly across the grass.  Celine is settled on the train and reading.  She looks up from her book and just stares out the window at the landscape going by. FADE OUT.72.",
