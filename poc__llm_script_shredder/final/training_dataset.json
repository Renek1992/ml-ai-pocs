        "script_context": "BEFORE SUNRISEbyRichard LinklaterKim KrizanFADE IN:INT. TRAIN - AFTERNOON11The Eurail rolls along.  Inside, passengers sleep, read, and stare out the windows.  A few walk up and down the aisles.  CELINE, a young woman in her mid-twenties, is curled up in her seat reading Georges Bataill\u2019s Story of the Eye.  Strikingly attractive, she plays it down by wearing no makeup, a loose-fitting vintage dress, and flat shoes.  She continues reading while taking an occasional bite of a chocolate bar.  Sitting four rows back and on the other side of the aisle, JESSE, also mid-twenties, is engrossed in Klaus Kinski\u2019s memoir, All I Need Is Love.  Casually good looking but a little scruffy, he dresses in the jeans and T-shirt mode.  Suddenly a couple, two fortyish types who have been arguing semiquietly in the seat behind Celine, start yelling at each other in German.  The WIFE takes a swipe at the newspaper the HUSBAND has been screening him behind.  WIFEWill you put down that damn newspaper and listen to me?HUSBANDWhat\u2019ve I been doing the last thirty minutes?  Would you shut up for Chrissake?WIFEYou shut up!  How dare you tell me to shut up!  It\u2019s the same damn thing all over again!  I can\u2019t believe --HUSBANDI said shut up!  I\u2019m putting down my newspaper and telling you to shut up.Celine suddenly gets up, grabs her bag, and starts looking for another seat.  A few rows back, she finds a seat across the aisle from Jesse.  Before sitting down, they make brief eye contact and kind of shake their heads and smile at the tension.  Just as she settles in and goes back to her book, the wife gets up and storms down the aisle.  Jesse and Celine follow her with their eyes, and as she passes them, they find they are looking right at each other.  He makes a funny \u201cuh-oh\u201d face.JESSEDo you have any idea what they\u2019re arguing about?  Do you speak English?CELINEYes.  But no, I don\u2019t know.  My German is not that good.(a beat)Have you ever heard that as couples get older they lose their ability to hear each other?JESSEReally?CELINESupposedly men lose their ability to hear higher-pitched sounds and women eventually lose hearing on the low end.  I guess they sort of nullify each other or something. JESSEMust be nature\u2019s way of allowing couples to grow old together and not kill each other, I guess. There\u2019s a slightly awkward moment where they don\u2019t know if they should continue talking or not.  She glances back down at her book but he keeps looking at her.  JESSE (CONT\u2019D)What are you reading?She holds up the book so he can see what it is. CELINEHow about you?He shows her what he\u2019s reading.  Neither has much to say about the other\u2019s reading material. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)There are so many weird people on the train, no?  Last week on my way to Budapest I was sitting and talking with four other people in the lounge car and it turned out that three of them had killed people. JESSENo way.2.CELINEReally.  One was a war veteran, one had murdered her boyfriend, and another had caused a bad car wreck.JESSESo you were the only one who hadn\u2019t killed anyone?CELINENo, I was one of them.  Which one do you think?She laughs and he slowly joins her. JESSEI know what you mean.  I\u2019ve met some weirdos.  There was this British guy sitting across from me the other day who kept throwing his body against the back of his chair, yelling about how we should all join together and stop the train.  He was saying, \u201cEverybody, now, we can stop technology.  All together...\u201dCELINESo what happened?He demonstrates by throwing his body against his seat. JESSEAnd you know, me and a few others tried for a while, but we couldn\u2019t stop technology. The wife who stormed away earlier suddenly comes back and the argument resumes, right in front of them. JESSE (CONT\u2019D)I was thinking about going to the lounge car sometimes soon.  You wanna go?CELINEWe better. They get up and walk to the door of their car.  He pushes the DOOR OPEN button, and as the door opens, he extends his hand toward her.3.JESSEOh, I\u2019m Jesse.  It\u2019s James, actually, but my whole life everyone\u2019s called me Jesse.CELINESo it\u2019s Jesse James?JESSENo, just Jesse.CELINECeline. They proceed through the door and Celine pushes the DOOR OPEN button to enter the next car.  There is some confusion as to who is opening the door for whom before Celine proceeds and jesse follows her toward the lounge car. INT. LOUNGE CAR - AFTERNOON 22They sit at a table, eating chips and taking an occasional swig from a drink. JESSESo how do you speak such good English?CELINEI went to school for a summer in Los Angeles and I\u2019ve spent some time in London.  How do you speak such good English?JESSEI\u2019m American. CELINEI know.  It\u2019s a joke.  I knew you were American, and, of course, you don\u2019t speak any other language. JESSEYeah, yeah, I\u2019m the dumb, vulgar American who has no culture.  But I tried.  I want you to know I took four years of French.  I tried, I was ready.  When I was in Paris, I was standing in line at the metro going, \u201cUn billet, s\u2019il vous pl\u00e2it.  4.\n(MORE)Un billet, s\u2019il vous pl\u00e2it.\u201d  And then I got up to the window, I looked up at the lady and blanked out.  \u201cUh, uh, I need a ticket for the subway.\u201d  No more French for me.(a beat)So where are you headed?CELINEBack to Paris.  My class starts next week. JESSEWhere do you go to school?CELINELa Sorbonne.  You know?JESSESure.  But you were in Budapest?CELINEYeah, I was visiting my grandmother.JESSEHow is she?CELINEOkay.  How about you - where are you going?JESSEVienna. CELINEWhat\u2019s there?JESSEI don\u2019t know.  I\u2019m flying out of there tomorrow morning. CELINEAre you on a holiday?JESSEI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m on.  I\u2019ve just been traveling around the last two or three weeks. CELINEWere you visiting friends, or just going around on your own?5.JESSE (CONT'D)JESSEI visited a friend in Madrid for a while, but mostly I\u2019ve just been...(new thought)I got one of those Eurail passes, and you know what\u2019s fascinating about traveling around?  You spend all this time trying to reach your destination, you get there, you look around, it\u2019s never exactly what you\u2019d hoped, you head off somewhere else, and hope for something better. CELINEIt\u2019s like getting ready for a party, getting there, and falling asleep.  That\u2019s why when I\u2019m traveling I kind of force myself not to expect anything from anywhere or anyone.  And then, whatever happens is a surprise.  The most insignificant thing can become an endless subject of interest, no?JESSEThat\u2019s what I like about traveling - you can sit down, maybe talk to someone interesting, see something beautiful, read a good book, and that\u2019s enough to qualify a good day.  You do that at home and everyone thinks you\u2019re a bum.CELINEI like that though.  But it\u2019s like my favorite American writers.  They describe everything you wouldn\u2019t want to live through, and yet you cannot stop reading of this exciting, boring life.  JESSESo what do you study?CELINELiterature.  But I haven\u2019t decided yet what I really want to do. JESSEDo you want to write?6.CELINEYeah, but...(new thought)I kind of had this obsession a few years ago about creating a new form of expression.  It was of course an abstract and lost quest, but I was feeling all art forms seemed used up.  I was especially rejecting words.  They seemed so rusted and dirty.  And they\u2019ve been used for such evil ends.  Sometimes, you know, language is so limited.  It\u2019s like...if you think about it...She holds her hands out fairly wide and round. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)This is an individual\u2019s mental experience and perception and...She holds her hands together and forms a small circle. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)This is how much can be expressed through language.  We just don\u2019t have words for so many of the impressions we have. She parts her hands and gestures to the large outer circle. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)So most of our life we will never be able to express to anyone. They sit there for an extended moment, neither sure what to say next.  Suddenly Jesse smiles and jokingly starts to get up. JESSESo I guess...that\u2019s it - it\u2019s been nice not communicating with you.  They both laugh. JESSE (CONT\u2019D)Really, though, I basically agree with you, and maybe it\u2019s a sad face of life, but I think it doesn\u2019t bother me that much.  Maybe I\u2019m wrong about this, but I think that lack of communication frustrates women more than men. 7.CELINEYes, because men are perfectly content to sit in front of TV all day drinking beer and watching sports. JESSEYeah, that\u2019s true, but have you ever done that?  I did it once with a friend of mine.  Drank some beer, had some chips, and watched a couple of games.  It was the first time in years I literally jumped for joy.  On some level it\u2019s sticking your head in the sand, but on another I think it must serve some tribal purpose. CELINEI actually agree with you.  I kind of like sports.  It\u2019s one of these few times when men are treated like stupid objects...I\u2019m joking.  So you haven\u2019t told me what you do.  Are you still in school?JESSENah, I never graduated from college.CELINEAre you working?JESSEI have a stupid job like everyone else. CELINEIs it boring?  You\u2019re not happy?JESSENo, it\u2019s a decent job.  I don\u2019t get paid that much.  I don\u2019t do that much. CELINESo what is the job?JESSEI write for a newspaper, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and pretty much get to do what I want there creatively, so it\u2019s okay. 8.CELINESo you write?JESSEKinda.CELINESo has this trip been good for you?JESSEYeah.  I mean, on one level, it sucked, but sitting on a train and staring out the window for days on end has actually been kind of great. CELINEWhat do you mean?JESSEI\u2019ve had an idea I probably would never have had otherwise.  Can I tell you about it? CELINEYes. JESSESome friends of mine are these cable access producers - you know, anyone can produce a program, and they have to show it.  I got really jazzed about it.  I imagined a show I want to produce that would last an entire year, twenty-four hours a day.  I want to get 365 different video producers around the world to each make their own twenty-four-hour-long document of real time, capturing life around them just as it is lived.  So it\u2019d be people waking up, taking a long shower, getting a cup of coffee and reading the paper for twenty minutes, a long drive to work.CELINEYou mean all those boring, mundane things everyone has to do every day of their life?JESSEI was going to say the poetry of day-to-day life.  9.\n(MORE)I mean, Why is your dog so great just for sleeping in the sun?  And a guy getting money out of a bank machine is a moron?CELINESo you can put on the TV at any time of the day and see what other people are doing at the same time.JESSERight.  It\u2019s like parallel lives. CELINEThat\u2019s great.  I once lived in a big apartment I was sharing with friends, and we could see ten other apartments from the window.  I would cut down the light, sit at the window, and watch them sitting on a couch doing nothing.  It was fascinating. JESSEThat\u2019s the trick.  Life is not really about drama.  That we all do the same shit and going to some market in Arabia is the same as going to Kmart in Miami.  People believe they are missing out, that everyone else has this great and exciting life and they don\u2019t.  I mean, we all have to get dressed, feed the kids, get our driver\u2019s licence renewed, look up what time the afternoon matinee starts, lose ourselves in entertainment, lose ourselves in sex, routine, getting a little too drunk, buying a present for someone you don\u2019t like very much - you feel guilty about not liking them, so you spend a little too much money. CELINESo, it\u2019s like a National Geographic  program on people. JESSEExactly.10.JESSE (CONT'D)CELINEI can see it: twenty-four boring hours and a three-minute sex scene where he falls asleep right after. JESSEExactly.  And that would be an exciting episode.  Maybe you and your friends can do one of those episodes from Paris.  The key to making this work would be in the distribution.  Getting the tapes from town to town on time...But it would play continuously twenty-four hours for a year on stations around the world. The waiter finally arrives and gives them the menus.INT. LOUNGE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON 33Some time has passed.  They have dirty dishes in front of them.  They seem more relaxed with each other, more forthright, less self-conscious, a little more intimate. CELINEMy parents have never really spoken of the possibility of my falling in love or getting married or having children.  Even as a little girl, they wanted me to think about a future career as a TV newscaster, or a dentist, or something like that. JESSE(smiles)Anchorwoman...CELINEYeah, I\u2019d say to my dad I wanted to be a writer and he\u2019d say journalist.  I\u2019d say I wanted to have a refuge for stray cats and he\u2019d say veterinarian.  I\u2019d say I wanted to be an actress and he\u2019d say TV newscaster.  It was this constant conversion of my fanciful ambitions into practical moneymaking ventures.  11.JESSEParents just want you to have a nice career so they can tell their friends something interesting.(a beat)I musta had a pretty decent bullshit detector when I was a kid.  I always knew when they were lying to me.  By the time I was in highschool, I was dead set on listening to what everyone thought I should be doing with my life and then almost systematically doing the opposite.  They weren\u2019t really mean about it.  All their typical ambitions sounded so mediocre. CELINEIf you have parents that never fully contradict anything you want to do and are basically nice and supportive, it makes it harder to officially complain.  Even when they are wrong.  It\u2019s this passive-aggressive shit.  I can\u2019t stand it. Jesse takes a swig of water and chews some ice. JESSEYeah, but despite plenty of bullshit, I still remember being a kid as a magical time. (a beat)I remember my mom explaining death to me, and telling me that my great- grandmother in Florida had died.  The whole family had just visited them.  I must have been three, three and a half years old.  Anyway, I was playing in the backyard a day or so later, and my sister had taught me how to spray the garden hose into the sun and see a rainbow.  Well, I was spraying it and through the mist I could see my great-grandmother standing there, just kind of smiling, looking at me.  I just held the hose in that position for a long time and looked at her.  Finally, I took my thumb off the nozzle, let the hose go, and she disappeared.  12.\n(MORE)My parents gave me this rap about how I imagined it and how when people die you never see them again.  But, I knew what I had seen, and even though I\u2019ve never seen anything like that since, I\u2019ve never really been very afraid of death.  CELINEThat\u2019s good you can have that attitude toward death.  I think I am afraid of death twenty-four hours a day.  That\u2019s why I\u2019m on the train.  I could have flown to Paris.  I\u2019m just afraid of flying.  Even though statistics say it\u2019s safer, I can\u2019t help it.  When I\u2019m sitting in a plane, I already can see an explosion, me falling through the clouds.  I\u2019m so afraid of the few seconds of consciousness before dying.  I mean, when you know for sure you\u2019re gonna die.  I can\u2019t help anticipating the worst.  Like, I was in the park with this friend of mine.  There were little kids playing around.  This mother was throwing her child up in the air.  My friend was smiling and thought it was so wonderful, and all I could think of was her dropping it.  I could already see all the blood on the ground.  The big panic, the mother crying...I think like this all the time.  It\u2019s exhausting. We see out the window that the train is pulling into Vienna.CELINE (CONT\u2019D)This is Vienna.  You get off here, no?JESSEDrag.  I wish I would have met you earlier.  I really like talking to you. CELINEIt was really nice talking to you, too. 13.JESSE (CONT'D)JESSEI\u2019ve hardly talked to anyone in weeks. EXT. TRAIN STATION - LATE AFTERNOON 44The train comes to a final stop.  The doors open and soon everyone is unboarding and boarding.INT. LOUNGE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON 55With a slight smile, Jesse looks intensely at Celine. JESSEI have an admittedly insane thought.  If I don\u2019t ask you this, it\u2019ll be one of those things that will haunt me forever. CELINEWhat?He just looks at her a little nervously and can\u2019t say it.  She is truly intrigued and a little excited at what he\u2019s struggling with. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)What?JESSEI want to keep talking with you.  I mean, I have no idea what your situation is, but I feel some kind of...connection.  CELINEYeah, me too. JESSESo how about this.  Okay, good...I want you to get off her in Vienna with me.  We can check out the town. She smiles at the thought but is not totally sure. CELINESo what would we do?14.JESSEI don\u2019t know.  All I know is I\u2019m getting on this Austria Airlines flight at nine-thirty tomorrow morning and I can\u2019t really afford a hotel and we\u2019ll probably just wander around all night.  If I turn out to be a psycho, you can bail out anytime and get back on the next train, right?She\u2019s still thinking but doesn\u2019t respond.JESSE (CONT\u2019D)Think of it like this.  Jump ahead ten, twenty years.  Your marriage just doesn\u2019t have that same energy anymore.  You start to blame your husband.  You think of all the guys you\u2019ve met and all the ones you never pursued and how things might have been different if you\u2019d just picked up with one of them.  Well, I\u2019m one of them.  You can consider this traveling back in time, to see what you are missing.  See, this is really a big favor to both you and your future husband - it\u2019s a chance to see how you really haven\u2019t missed anything.  That I\u2019m just as boring and unmotivated as he is, hopefully more. She smiles a little, ponders the situation, and then just stands up. CELINEI\u2019m not sure if I got all the story, but let me get my bag. EXT. TRAIN STATION - LATE AFTERNOON 66He gets off the train with his bags and starts walking, not fully aware she\u2019s not right behind him.  She has hesitated slightly and pauses at the top of the stairs.  After glancing back briefly, she looks ahead and proceeds with confidence. INT. TRAIN STATION - LATE AFTERNOON 77Inside the busy train station lobby, they stop at a change machine and exchange currency.  15.INT. TRAIN STATION - LATE AFTERNOON 88He finishes putting his stuff in a locker.  She opens a locker and stuffs her bag in.CELINEYou know what this makes me think of?JESSEWhat?CELINEAll those people you briefly intersect with, maybe make eye contact with, and then pass by.JESSEYes, we could have done that.  Now it\u2019s like...CELINENo matter what happens, we have met. Jesse just smiles and offers up his open hand.  She touches her hand to his and there is a slow clasp and a slight pull toward one another. JESSEThat we have. EXT. BRIDGE - DAY99Walking along in silence, they both are observing what is around them and eventually look back at each other.  Fully realizing they are now committed to one another in some strange way, there is an awkward silence. CELINEIt\u2019s such a strange feeling.  When we were talking on the train, it\u2019s like we were in public - there were people around us.  Now that we\u2019re actually walking around Vienna, it\u2019s like we are all alone. JESSEI know.  It feels a little awkward.  I\u2019m not sure what we should be doing. He puts his hand on her shoulder and looks right at her. 16.JESSE (CONT\u2019D)But this is okay, though, right?CELINEYes, this is great.  Let\u2019s go to some places.  Look at your little book. He pulls out a little pamphlet/map and starts looking through it. JESSEGood.  Right.  We\u2019re in Vienna and we\u2019re going to go places.Just then two local passersby, TEX and KARL, walk past them.  Jesse stops them. JESSE (CONT\u2019D)Excuse me.  Sprechen Sie English?KARLYah, of course. TEXPerhaps you speak German for a change?JESSEWhat?TEXIt was a joke. Tex looks over at Karl, both in on it. JESSEWe just got into Vienna and we\u2019re looking for something fun to do...CELINEYeah, are there any museums we should see or anything?TEXMuseums are not exactly fun these days. Karl looks at his watch. KARLAnd they are all closing right now, anyway.  How long are you going to be here?17.JESSEJust tonight. TEXWhy did you come to Vienna?  What could you be expecting?CELINEWe\u2019re on our honeymoon...JESSEYeah, she\u2019s pregnant, so we decided to go ahead and get married. TEXI don\u2019t believe you.  You are not very good at lying. Celine and Jesse laugh while Tex and Karl talk amongst themselves in German. TEX (CONT\u2019D)Do you have the fliers?KARLYeah, I\u2019ll give them one. Karl digs in his pocket and hands a flier to them. TEXThis is a play we\u2019re both in we\u2019d like you to come to. CELINESo you are actors?TEXNot professional actors, but part-time for fun. KARLIt\u2019s a play about a cow, and an Indian searching for it.  It also has politicians, Mexicans, Russians...JESSEYou have a real cow onstage?TEXNot a real cow.  It\u2019s an actor in a cow costume. 18.KARLAnd he\u2019s the cow. TEXYes, I\u2019m the cow.  But it\u2019s a weird cow. KARLThe cow has a disease. TEXShe\u2019s acting a bit strange...acting like a dog.  If someone throws a stick, she fetches it.  She also smokes, with her hoofs. He demonstrates how one would smoke with a hoof instead of a hand.  Karl points to the bottom of the flier. KARLThe address is on the flier.  It\u2019s in the second district...TEXNear the Prater...KARLYes, the place with the big Ferris wheel.TEXThe big wheel everybody knows...KARLPerhaps you can go to the Prater before the play. JESSESo what\u2019s the name of this play?KARLIt translates as...BOTH\u201cBring Me the Horns of Wilmington\u2019s Cow.\u201dJESSESounds great.CELINECool.19.Tex puts his index finger up by his head as everyone begins to walk away. TEXI am the cow...and you will be there?JESSEWe\u2019ll try to make it. EXT. BETWEEN THE MUSEUMS - DAY1010They sit on a bench near a statue, looking up at the historic buildings and surroundings. JESSELook at this - it\u2019s beautiful.  I mean, could you imagine an American architect saying, \u201cHey, Bob, I\u2019ve got an idea.  Why don\u2019t we put a giant angel on top of this building just for people to have something beautiful to look at.\u201d  It might start out like that, but before too long it\u2019d be, \u201cSorry, Hank, boss said nix on the giant angel.  He\u2019s thinking more along the lines of a flagpole.\u201dCELINEAmericans always think Europe is perfect.  But such beauty and history can be really oppressive.  It reduces the individual to nothing.  It just reminds you all the time you are just a little speck in a long history, where in America you feel like you could be making history.  That\u2019s why I liked Los Angeles because it is so...JESSEUgly?CELINENo, I was going to say \u201cneutral.\u201d  It\u2019s like looking at a blank canvas.(a beat)20.\n(MORE)I think people go to places like Venice on their honeymoon to make sure they are not going to fight for the first two weeks of their marriage because they\u2019ll be too busy looking around at all the beautiful things.  That\u2019s what people call a romantic place - somewhere where the prettiness with contain your primary violent instinct.  A real good honeymoon spot would be like somewhere in New Jersey. EXT. TRAM STATION - DAY 1111They come down the escalator and board a tram. INT. TRAM - DAY1212They are sitting in the tram and observing everything going by.JESSEOkay, Q&A time.  We\u2019ve known each other for a little while now, we\u2019re stuck with each other, we can ask each other a few, you know, direct questions. CELINESo we ask each other questions?JESSEAnd you have to answer one hundred percent honestly.CELINEOf course.Celine picks up on the game he is talking about. JESSEFirst question.  Describe your first sexual feelings toward someone. CELINEWell, let me think...Jean-Marc Fleury.21.CELINE (CONT'D)JESSEJean-Marc Fleury?CELINEWe were at this summer camp together and he was a swimmer.  He had that bleached-out, chlorine hair and green eyes, and to improve his times, he\u2019d shave the hair off his legs and arms.  So he was like this gorgeous dolphin.  My friend Emma had a big crush on him, and one day I was cutting across the field on my way back to my room, he came walking up beside me.  I told him he should ask Emma out because she had a big crush on him, and he said, \u201cThat\u2019s too bad, because I have a big crush on you.\u201d  And it really scared the hell out of me because I thought he was so fine.  He officially asked me out on a date but I pretended that I didn\u2019t like him because I was afraid of what I might do.  But I went to a swim competition and watched him swimming around.  He was so sexy.  At the end of the summer we sort of wrote these little declarations of love to each other and said we would keep writing and for sure meet again soon. JESSEDid you?CELINEOf course not. JESSEI think then this is the appropriate time to tell you I happen to be an excellent swimmer.CELINEOkay, I\u2019ll make a note, but it\u2019s my turn to ask a question.  Have you ever been in love?He thinks for a bit and then starts in. JESSEYes.  Okay, next question.  What do you think is you --22.CELINEWait a minute.  We can give on-word answers?JESSEWhy not?CELINEAfter I went into such detail about my first sexual feelings?JESSEBut there\u2019s a big difference between those two things.  I could tell you all about my first sexual feelings, no big deal.  What if I asked you about love?CELINEI would have lied, but at least I would\u2019ve made a great story. JESSESee.  The whole concept of love is much more complex.  Love\u2019s like God or something: It\u2019s everywhere...I see it, I feel it, but I don\u2019t know if another person is going to hand it to me. CELINEUnfortunately, I know what you mean. JESSEFor what it\u2019s worth, my first sexual feelings were experienced through an obsessive relationship with Miss July, 1978.  You know Playboy?CELINEYes.JESSEOkay, name something that really pisses you off.CELINEOh, gosh, everything pisses me off. JESSELike what?23.CELINEI hate being told by strange men to smile, just to make them feel better about their stupid lives.  I hate that three hundred kilometers away a war is going on.  People are dying.  And nobody knows what to do about it.  I hate how the media tries to control our minds.  It\u2019s a new form of very subtle fascism.  And I hate in a foreign country each time I wear black or lose my temper or express an opinion about anything, everyone always goes: \u201cOh, it\u2019s so French, it\u2019s so cute.\u201d  Oh, I hate that. They both laugh a bit at her becoming riled up so quickly.  She calms down and asks him a question. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)It\u2019s my turn now.  So what\u2019s a problem for you?JESSEYou, probably.CELINEHuh?JESSENo, really, I had a thought about a week ago that\u2019s kind of a problem. CELINEWhat is it?JESSEDo you believe in reincarnation?CELINEOn some level it\u2019s interesting.JESSEYeah.  It seems like a lot of people are talking about past lives and all that.  And even if you don\u2019t believe in that in a specific way, most people have some notion of an eternal soul, right?  Anyway, my thought was, if we all have our origins at the beginning of human history in some way, where did all the current souls come from?  24.\n(MORE)The earth\u2019s population fifty thousand years ago was not even a million people.  Ten thousand years ago, it was only a few million.  Now, the earth\u2019s population is between five and six billion.  That\u2019s about a five-thousand-to-one split of each soul in just the last fifty thousand years, which is just a blip in the earth\u2019s time.  At best, we\u2019re just a tiny fraction of a soul.  Is that why we all feel so scattered?CELINESo, that\u2019s a problem?JESSEI know, it\u2019s kind of a scattered thought, which is all the more reason it makes sense. INT. RECORD STORE - DAY 1313They enter the old, vinyl-only store and start to browse.JESSEIs that a listening booth over there?CELINEYes, I think so. They keep looking through albums.  She eventually finds an album and holds it up to him. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)Have you ever heard of this singer?JESSE(reading)No.CELINEI think she\u2019s American.  I have this friend in LA who told me about her.  I\u2019ve never been able to find any of her stuff.  I think it\u2019s kind of folksy, lyrical stuff. Jesse points across the store. 25.JESSE (CONT'D)JESSELets\u2019 see if that listening booth works. CELINELet\u2019s try it. They walk over to the booth and enter.  She takes the album out and puts it on the turntable.  As the music starts they both kind of lean against opposite walls in the small glass booth and concentrate on the song. SONGThere\u2019s a wind that blows in from the northAnd it says that loving takes its course Come here, come hereNo, I\u2019m not impossible to touchI have never wanted you so muchCome here.  Come here...They glance subtly up at each other but usually not when the other is looking.  The song makes both of them a little nervous as it brings out a shyness about the uncertainty of their relationship at that point. INT. SUBWAY - DAY 1414They ride on a subway as it breaks out of a tunnel into sunlight. EXT. NAMELESS CEMETERY - DAY1515They walk down the steps toward the small cemetery.  A rabbit runs past them. CELINEI visited this as a young teenager.  It left a bigger impression on me at that time than any of the museums we went to. JESSEIt\u2019s small. Inside, they wander around looking at the mostly identical crosses. 26.CELINEYes.  There was this little old man who talked to us.  He was the groundskeeper.  Almost everyone buried here washed up on the bank where the Danube curves away.JESSEHow old are these?CELINEAround the beginning of the century or so.  It\u2019s called Cemetery of the No Name because they often didn\u2019t really know who these people were.  Maybe a first name. JESSEWhy were there so many bodies washing up on the banks of the Danube?CELINEI think some were from accidents on boats and things like that, but most of them were suicides that jumped in the river.(a beat)I always liked the idea of all these unknown people, lost in the world.  When I was young I always thought that if none of your family or friends knew you were dead, then it\u2019s like not really being dead.  People can invent the best or the worst for you.She stops by one grave. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)Oh, here she is.  This is the one I remember the most.  She was thirteen when she died.  That meant something to me because I was that age when I saw this.  Now I\u2019m ten years older and she\u2019s still...thirteen, I guess. EXT. TRAM STATION - DUSK1616Montage shot of them riding on the tram at dusk.27.EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - SUNSET 1717They are in the huge old Ferris wheel in the Prater amusement park.  They have a large box to themselves and walk around in it looking at the various views. CELINEWhen I\u2019m up above everyone like this, I always think like the entire human race is this body, and we\u2019re all cells in the body.  It\u2019s an amazing, exquisite mess, no?JESSEYeah...(a beat)I want to change the subject for a second.  This could be an important moment.  I don\u2019t know if you noticed, but we\u2019re alone in this car.  The sun is going down...(a beat)Before the night is over, is it safe to assume that we\u2019re going to kiss?CELINEMaybe.JESSEMaybe?CELINEProbably. JESSEProbably.  Then I propose we jump in time to that moment when we would naturally do that - probably a couple of hours from now after a certain amount of awkwardness and stuff - and bring that moment back to here and now, given these ideal surroundings.  It\u2019ll be a great way to remember not only our first kiss, but this great sunset, the Ferris wheel, Vienna...Celine walks over to him and puts her arms around his neck. CELINEHow come every time you want me to do something, you start talking about time travel?28.JESSEOkay, I think we should kiss right now. They begin kissing and the Ferris wheel keeps moving. EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT 1818Walking along, they are in mid-conversation.CELINEBut I don\u2019t think it matters what generation you\u2019re born into.  Look at my parents.  They were these angry young May \u201868 people revolting against everything - the government, their conservative Catholic backgrounds.  I was born not long after and my dad went on to become this successful architect and we began to travel all over the world and I was raised with all the freedoms they had fought for.  And yet for me now, it\u2019s another type of fight.  We still have to deal with all the same shit.  But you can\u2019t really know what or who the enemy is. JESSEI don\u2019t know if there is an enemy.  Everyone\u2019s parents fucked them up.  They either left them or stuck around and taught them the wrong stuff.  Rich kids\u2019 parents give them too much, poor kids\u2019 not enough.  You either get too much attention or not enough.  My parents are just these two people who didn\u2019t like each other very much who got married and had a kid.  And they tried to be nice to me. CELINEDid your parents divorce?JESSEYeah, finally.  They should have done it earlier, but they stuck together for the well-being of my sister and me.  Thanks.(a beat)29.\n(MORE)You know, my mom once told me, right in front of my father when they were in this big fight, that he was really, really pissed off when he found out she was pregnant with me - that I was this big mistake.  Looking back on it, I think that shaped the way I think.  I saw the world as this place I wasn\u2019t really meant to be and had the people who created me had more control of the situation, I wouldn\u2019t exist. CELINEBut that\u2019s so sad.JESSEI think I eventually found a comfort in that.  Like my life was my own doing or something. CELINEMy parents are still together and I think they\u2019re happy.  But I think it\u2019s a healthy process to rebel against your parents and everything that came before.  In a certain way, more than rebelling, it\u2019s to have the feeling that we\u2019re finding a new way to deal with love, sex, society, everything.  We should always have to reinvent and make it our own. They walk in silence, just taking in all around them for a few moments.  A couple walks by, but both are completely in their own worlds. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)I\u2019ve been wondering lately...do you know anyone who\u2019s in a happy relationship?JESSEYeah, I know happy couples, but it seems like they have to lie to each other. CELINEPeople can live their whole life as a lie.  30.JESSE (CONT'D)\n(MORE)My grandmother was married to this man, and I always thought she had a very simple, uncomplicated love life.  But she just confessed to me that she spent her life dreaming about another man she was always in love with.  She just accepted her fate.  I was so sad.  But I also found it very beautiful that she had all those emotions I never thought she would have had.JESSEI guarantee you that it was better that way.  Had she got to know him, he would have disappointed her eventually. CELINEHow do you know?  You don\u2019t know who they are.JESSEI know.  It\u2019s just people have all these romantic projections. CELINEWhat do you mean, Mr. Romantic up in the Ferris wheel kiss me now as the sun is going down...?JESSE(interrupting)All right, all right.  What about your grandmother?  Finish your thought.CELINEIt just amazed me that I\u2019ve spent over twenty years of my life around her and I didn\u2019t know her. JESSEYou know her, but no one really knows anyone.  That\u2019s the thing about relationships - people are always saying, \u201cI want to know you, I want to know who you are.\u201d  But it is so hard for anyone to even know themselves.  Who I am is always changing, so how can anyone else share in that?31.CELINE (CONT'D)CELINESo that\u2019s it?  It\u2019s been nice not knowing you. They look over and see several elderly couples riding the bumper cars. EXT. KLEINES CAF\u00c9 - NIGHT1919They are sitting at a table in a sparsely populated outdoor caf\u00e9.  Jesse looks around briefly and then suddenly leans over and kisses a slightly surprised Celine. JESSEI just wanted to kiss you again. Celine sort of smiles and shrugs her shoulders when a ROSE PEDDLER suddenly approaches them.  She is an older gypsy-looking woman and holds up her bunch of roses toward Jesse.ROSE PEDDLER(in German)You buy a rose for the young lady?Jesse smiles and digs in his pocket.JESSESure, how many schillings?ROSE PEDDLERTwenty.As Jesse hands her the coins and she gives him the rose, she suddenly turns all her attention to Celine.  She impulsively grabs her hand and intensely starts looking at her palm.ROSE PEDDLER (CONT\u2019D)You want your palm read?CELINESure.Celine looks over at Jesse, who rolls his eyes, feeling a little invaded.  She flashes him a \u201cI want to do this, don\u2019t spoil it\u201d look.ROSE PEDDLERHmmm.  Uhh-huuh.  So you have been on a journey and you are a stranger to this place.  You are an adventurer...a seeker...and adventurer in your mind. 32.Celine is engrossed and occasionally nods.ROSE PEDDLER (CONT\u2019D)You are interested in the power of the woman.  In a woman\u2019s deep strength and creativity.  You are becoming this woman.(a beat)You need to resign yourself to the awkwardness of life.  Only if you find peace within yourself will you find true connections with others.The rose peddler looks up at Jesse and gestures to him.ROSE PEDDLER (CONT\u2019D)This is a stranger to you, yes?CELINEWell, yeah, I guess.The rose peddler authoritatively reaches for Jesse\u2019s hand, which he awkwardly offers up.  She examines his hand thoroughly, flips it over, examines his thumb, and lets him take it back.ROSE PEDDLER(to Celine)You\u2019ll be alright(a beat)He is learning. (a beat)Okay?CELINEThank you.  That was good. Celine gets up and hands the woman several coins.  As she walks away, the older lady adds one last bit.  ROSE PEDDLERYou are both stars, don\u2019t forget.  When the stars exploded billions of years ago, they formed everything that is this world.  The moon, the trees, everything we know is stardust.  So don\u2019t forget.  You are stardust.  They walk away, and Celine is filled with the experience but Jesse looks a little annoyed.  The more he builds up to a rant, the more amused she seems to get. 33.JESSEThat\u2019s all nice and everything, we are stardust and all that, and you are becoming this great woman, but I hope you don\u2019t think that\u2019s much different than reading your horoscope in some syndicated daily paper. CELINEWell, she knew I was on vacation and that we didn\u2019t know each other and that I was going to become this great woman. JESSE(interrupting)And what was that \u201cI am learning\u201d bullshit?  That\u2019s waaay condescending - she wasn\u2019t even doing me, and I even bought that fucking rose from her. (starting rant)If opportunists like that would ever tell the real truth, it would put their asses out of business.(new thought)Just once I want to see some old lady save up her money, and just as she\u2019s about to hear all this great stuff, the fortune teller would say, (wide-eyed stare)\u201cTomorrow and all your remaining days will be a lot like today, a tedious collection of hours.  You will have no new passions, travels, or thoughts.  When you die you will be forgotten.  Two hundred schillings, please.\u201d  That I\u2019d like to see. Celine plays with him. CELINESo it\u2019s funny how she almost didn\u2019t notice you.  I loved what she said. JESSEOf course you do.  You pay your money, you get to hear something that makes you feel good.  34.\n(MORE)Hey, maybe there\u2019s some seedy section of Vienna where you can buy a hit of crack. Celine continues to laugh at him.EXT. STREET - NIGHT2020As they are walking, Celine notices a poster for an upcoming exhibit of Seurat\u2019s drawings.CELINEOh, man, this doesn\u2019t start until next week - we\u2019ll miss it. She motions to one of the drawings on the poster. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)I actually saw this one at a museum a few years ago.  I just stared and stared at it - must have been forty-five minutes.  JESSECool.CELINEI love the way the people seem to be dissolving into the background.  It\u2019s like the environments are stronger than the people.  His human figures always seem so transitory.EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT2121As they walk down the street, they wander up the steps to a large cathedral.  They check to see if the door is open.  It is, and they go inside. INT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT2222They enter to find it completely empty but with hundreds of candles still burning.  In the background we hear the sound of the organ being tuned. JESSEToo bad it isn\u2019t daytime so we could see the stained glass windows better. 35.JESSE (CONT'D)CELINEI was in an old church like this one with my grandmother in Budapest a few days ago.  Even though I reject most of the religious thing, I can\u2019t help but feeling for all those people that come here lost, or in pain, guilt - who come here looking for answers.  It fascinates me how a single place can join so much pain and happiness, for so many generations. JESSESo you\u2019re pretty close to your grandmother.CELINEYes, I think so.  I think it\u2019s because I\u2019ve always had this feeling that I\u2019m this very old woman, laying down, about to die, and her last thoughts are the remembrance of her youth and her life.  I feel like my life is just her memories or something. JESSEThat\u2019s wild.  I always feel like I\u2019m still this thirteen-year-old boy who doesn\u2019t really know how to be an adult.  So it\u2019s like I\u2019m pretending to live a life, taking notes for when I\u2019ll really have to do it.  Kind of like a dress rehearsal for a junior high play.CELINEThat\u2019s funny.  So up there in the Ferris wheel it was this very old woman kissing this very young boy.JESSEGet your head out of the gutter.(new thought)Do you know anything about the Quakers?CELINENo, not much.36.JESSEIt\u2019s really cool.  I went to this Quaker wedding once, and do you know how they do it?  The couple kneels down in the middle of the church in front of everyone, and they stare at each other.  Nobody speaks unless God moves them to say something - a blessing, a warning, nothing, whatever.  And then after an hour of staring into each other\u2019s eyes, they\u2019re married. CELINEThat\u2019s beautiful.  I like that.They stare at each other for an extended moment.  He suddenly has a new thought and smiles. JESSEGosh, this is kind of a horrible story, but maybe this is an appropriate place to tell it.  I was driving around with this buddy of mine who\u2019s this big atheist, and we came to a stop where there was this homeless guy holding up a sign saying he needed a job or something.  My friend holds out a hundred-dollar bill to him and asks, \u201cDo you believe in God?\u201d  The guy looks at him, looks at the money, and says, \u201cYes, I do.\u201d  My friend goes, \u201cWrong answer,\u201d and drives away.CELINEThat\u2019s so mean. EXT. OUTDOOR CAF\u00c9 - NIGHT2323As the rain falls, they run for cover, finding a seat under a huge umbrella in an outdoor caf\u00e9.EXT. STREET - NIGHT2424They walk along. JESSEWould you be in Paris yet if you hadn\u2019t gotten off the train?37.CELINENo, not yet.  And what would you be doing?JESSEI don\u2019t know - hanging out at the airport, reading old magazines, crying in my coffee because you wouldn\u2019t get off the train with me. CELINEAhh...She gives him a little kiss. CELINE (CONT\u2019D)Actually, I\u2019d probably have gotten off the train in Salzburg with someone else. JESSEYeah, yeah.  I\u2019m just that American decorating your blank canvas.CELINENo, no.  I\u2019m having a great time. JESSEReally?  Me too. CELINEI\u2019m glad.  I love this because no one knows I\u2019m here and I don\u2019t know anyone that knows you that would tell me all the bad things you\u2019ve done. JESSEI can tell you some.CELINEI\u2019m sure.  You hear so much shit about people.  When I start dating a guy, I always feel like a general in the army - you know, plotting my strategy and maneuverings, knowing his weak points, what would hurt him, seduce him...(a beat)But if we were around each other all the time, what would be the first thing about me that would drive you crazy?38.JESSEI don\u2019t want to answer that.  I dated this girl once who used to always ask me that.  Finally, I told her that I thought that she didn\u2019t handle criticism very well.  Then she flew into a rage and broke up with me.  But I think she really just wanted the chance to say what she thought was wrong with me.  So just tell me what it is about me that bugs you. CELINENo, there\u2019s nothing.JESSETell me.  C\u2019mon, what?CELINEI can\u2019t think of anything.JESSEI\u2019m demanding you say something. CELINEActually, if I think about it, I didn\u2019t like this kind of behavior back at the palm reader.  You were like this little rooster prick. JESSERooster prick?  What the hell is that?CELINEYes, you were like this little child whining because all the attention wasn\u2019t focused on him. JESSEWhat are you talking about?  This woman robs you blind...CELINEYou were acting like a little boy walking by an ice cream shop, crying because his mother wouldn\u2019t buy him a milk shake or something.JESSEWait a second.  I didn\u2019t care what this flower-peddling charlatan had to say about anything.39.A man, the HOMELESS POET, approaches them. HOMELESS POET(in German)I\u2019d like to ask you something. CELINEUh, I speak okay, but he doesn\u2019t at all. HOMELESS POET(in English)Okay, then.  I\u2019d like to make a deal with you guys.  Instead of just asking for money, I\u2019ll ask you for a word.  I will then write a poem in which that word will be used.  I\u2019ll write it in English.  If you like it, if you feel it adds something to your life in any way, then you can pay me whatever you feel like. CELINE AND JESSEOkay, it\u2019s a deal.HOMELESS POETPick a word.JESSEUhh...(to Celine)What word?CELINEMilk shake.Jesse flashes her a look. JESSEI was going to say \u201crooster prick.\u201d  But perfect, of course, milk shake. The poet walks off a ways and starts writing. CELINEI like what he said about adding something to your life.JESSEI know.  Hey, were we just arguing back there?40.CELINENo, no...JESSEYeah, I think we were. CELINEEven if we were, why does everyone think conflict is so bad?  Good things can come out of conflict. JESSEI guess so.  I think if I could just accept the fact that life is supposed to be difficult, and that\u2019s what\u2019s to be expected, then I wouldn\u2019t get so pissed off about it.  I\u2019d just be happy when something nice happened. CELINEI think That\u2019s why I\u2019m still in school.  It\u2019s easier to have something to fight against. JESSEAnd we\u2019ve all had this competitiveness drilled into us.(thinking)I mean, I can be doing the most nothing thing - shooting pool or playing darts socially - and I\u2019ll feel it come over me: I want to win, I want to do the best I can, and my standards suddenly shift to just beyond my abilities.  I can hear every coach or male teacher or boss I ever had.  \u201cJesse, you\u2019re not trying hard enough!  Get your head out of your ass!  Hustle up!\u201dCELINEIs that why you tried to get me off the train?  Competitiveness?JESSEWhat do you mean?CELINETo make sure the guy behind you didn\u2019t pick me up?  Where you competing with him?41.JESSEWhat guy?CELINEThat really cute, big, strong, Italian-looking guy two seats behind you that was smiling at me the whole time. JESSEHe\u2019s better-looking than me?The homeless poet returns with a small piece of paper. CELINE(to Jesse)C\u2019est la vie. HOMELESS POETI have your poem.CELINEWill you read it to us?HOMELESS POETSure.(reads poem)Daydream delusionlimousine eyelashOh baby with your pretty facedrop a tear in my wineglassLook at those big eyes on your facesee what you mean to meSweet cakes and milk shakesI\u2019m a delusion angel  I\u2019m a fantasy paradeI want you to know what I thinkdon\u2019t want you to guess anymoreYou have no idea where I came from we have no idea where we\u2019re going       Lodged in life like branches in a river  flowing downstreamcaught in the currentI\u2019ll carry you you carry me that\u2019s how it could be  don\u2019t you know me  don\u2019t you know me by nowThey are both silent. 42.CELINEWow...They give him some money.JESSEThanks, man.  Good luck.CELINEIt\u2019s beautiful, no?JESSEYeah, that was beautiful.  You know, he didn\u2019t just write that poem...I\u2019m not saying he didn\u2019t write that poem.  He just didn\u2019t write it tonight.  He just plugged in that milk shake. CELINEWhat do you mean?JESSENothing.  It\u2019s a nice poem.They walk away. EXT. STREET - NIGHT2525They continue walking along.CELINEI want to ask you something.  Do you consider me detached?JESSEDetached from what?CELINESomeone once called me this detached intellectual.  I\u2019m afraid I am like that.  I comment too much on thing and maybe don\u2019t feel close enough to anything. JESSEI don\u2019t feel that way about you at all. Whoever said that is an asshole.43.CELINENo, but it\u2019s my biggest fear.  To be one of those people with that sort of academic, liberal, detached view of everything.  That whole attitude has nothing to do with really living. JESSEWho\u2019s to say what\u2019s really living?CELINEWell, I wonder.  That\u2019s the big question, no?  I think it\u2019s either a life experienced or a life examined.  But life examined is life experienced.(a beat)Maybe if I had none of these stupid artistic pretensions at all, I would be looking at the world differently. JESSEI know what you mean. CELINEWhat\u2019s that Thomas Mann quote?  \u201cI would rather participate in life than write a hundred stories.\u201dJESSEHmmm, I like that. (a beat)I knew this guy once, this kind of nerdy goth-rock guy.  And he was crossing the street one day, and he got hit by a car.  We all went to see him in the hospital, and he was going to be okay and everything, but he told us that his strongest sensation from the accident was the joy he felt when he realized that finally something was actually happening to him. They both laugh. CELINEYeah, it\u2019s like seeing yourself from a third-person perspective.  I always feel like I\u2019m observing my life instead of living it.  44.\n(MORE)At my grandfather\u2019s funeral, even though I loved him, it seemed everyone else was mourning and I was too busy observing them; each of them was like a paragraph of a book I might write someday, describing every emotion in detail.JESSEI know.  I remember when I was younger listening to my parents fight and feeling like I was in an after-school special on TV.  Thinking I should act moody, or depressed.  I should steal some cigarettes and sunglasses, get caught, and then blame it on the fact that I come from a troubled home. CELINEYeah, I think I\u2019m always so much more happy with books and movies and stuff.  I think I get more excited about well-done representations of life than life itself. EXT. HOT DOG STAND - NIGHT 2626They walk up to Viennese hot dog stand and order something to drink.  They notice some of the interesting characters hanging around, including the man behind the corner.INT. CAF\u00c9 - NIGHT2727They enter an interesting old caf\u00e9.  Celine goes to the bathroom while Jesse waits.  Separated from her for the first time, he stands around a bit awkwardly, observing posters and the goings-on in the caf\u00e9.  She eventually returns and they exit the caf\u00e9.EXT. ARENA CLUB - NIGHT2828They walk in front of a bar/club from which there is music coming out. JESSEYou want to go in?45.CELINE (CONT'D)CELINEYeah.  Is there a cover?JESSEIt\u2019s cheap.  I\u2019ll pay.CELINEDon\u2019t worry about it.  I\u2019ve got some cash. INT. ARENA CLUB - NIGHT 2929A SINGER with a guitar is onstage finishing up a weird but humorous song.  He finishes and gets up to leave. SINGER(in German)Hey, um, stick around.  I think Liz is going to show her latest film and provide some verbal accompaniment. A projector is set up to show against the back wall of the stage.  The filmmaker, LIZ, takes the microphone and sits on the stage facing the screen.  She has a piece of paper in her hand and signals for the projectionist to start.  The room darkens and the film begins.  Behind the first black-and-white Super 8 images is the title scratched in white, in German: A KIND OF NOISE AND A KIND OF SILENCE.  The film consists of images of fairly recent (1985-1994) events, bands playing, catastrophes, televised images.  Interspersed throughout is an eerie series of images of solitary individuals, some looking at the camera, some away.  The film evokes a melancholy and almost romantic loneliness.  She speaks in German and we read subtitles. LIZOur critique began, as all critiques begin, with doubt...doubt became our life.  Ours was a quest for a new story, our own, and we grasped toward this new history, driven by the Dada suspicion that ordinary language could not tell it.(a beat)Our past appeared frozen in the distance and our every gesture and accent bespoke the negation of an old world and the reach for a new one.(a beat)46.\n(MORE)The discovery of a true communication was what it was about - or at least the quest for such a communication, the adventure of finding it and losing it...we continued looking, the unappeased and the unaccepting, beneath, outside, dispersed, communicating only by a passing glance but still knowing that no matter how empty the world seemed, no matter how degraded and used up the world appeared to be, anything was still possible. Scratched on the film for a closing credit: TO BEGIN AGAIN, FROM THE BEGINNING.INT. BAR INSIDE THE ARENA COMPOUND - NIGHT3030They are taking turns playing pinball. JESSESo, we haven\u2019t even talked about this, but, uh, are you dating anyone?  You got a boyfriend waiting for you in Paris or anything like that?CELINENo, no, not right now...JESSEYou did?CELINEWe broke up over six months ago.JESSEI\u2019m sorry.  I mean, I\u2019m not that sorry, but, uh, tell me about it. CELINENo, no, it\u2019s boring.  I can\u2019tJESSEC\u2019mon, c\u2019mon.CELINEI was really disappointed.  I thought this one would last a while.  47.LIZ (CONT'D)\n(MORE)He was very stupid, ugly, bad in bed, alcoholic - I was kind of giving him a favor.  But he left me saying I loved him too much and because I was blocking his artistic expression.  I was traumatized and became totally obsessed with him.  I went to see a shrink and it came up that I had written these little stories about how I was going to kill him - all the intricate details about how I would do it and not get caught. JESSEKill him?She realizes Jesse is looking at her a bit strangely. CELINEOh no, it\u2019s nothing I would ever do, I think it was just some writing. JESSEI understand.CELINEAnyway, but this stupid shrink believed everything I was telling her.  She said she had to call the police.  She was totally convinced I was really going to do it even though I told her it was just my way of dealing with it.  She said, looking deep into my eyes, \u201cThe way you said it, I know you are going to do it.\u201d  That was my first and last session.  I totally got over him, but now I\u2019m obsessed that he\u2019s going to die from an accident, maybe a thousand kilometers away, and I will be accused. Jesse just smiles.  They change positions and she begins playing.CELINE (CONT\u2019D)Why is it you become obsessed with the people you don\u2019t really care for?(a beat)So, what about you?  Are you with anyone?48.CELINE (CONT'D)JESSEFunny, how we avoided this question for so long.CELINEI know, but now you have to tell me. JESSEI don\u2019t know.  Love is like this escape for people who haven\u2019t learned to be alone or to make something of themselves.  People think love is this unselfish or totally giving thing.  But if you think about it, there\u2019s probably nothing more selfish. CELINESo who just broke up with you?JESSEWhat?CELINESounds like you just got hurt.JESSEOkay...big confession.(a beat)Actually, I\u2019ll tell you something.  I didn\u2019t just come to Europe to find myself and read Hemingway in Paris and shit like that.  I worked all spring saving up money to fly to Madrid to spend the summer with my girlfriend, who\u2019s been on this asinine art history program for the last year.  But I got over here, and on our first night, reunited at long last, we went out to dinner, with five of her friends: Gonzalo, Pedro, Maria, Antonio, Suzie from home.  She pretty much avoided being alone with me the first couple of days I was there, but I stuck around awhile just to let it sink in that she wished I hadn\u2019t come.  So I got the cheapest charter flight out of Europe, this one leaving out of Vienna tomorrow, but I had a couple of weeks to kill, so I bought a Eurail pass. (a beat)49.\n(MORE)You know what the worst thing about someone breaking up with you is?  Remembering how little you really thought about the people you broke up with and realizing that\u2019s how little they\u2019re thinking about you.  You like to think you are both in so much pain, but really they\u2019re just relieved you\u2019re gone.  CELINEWell, you should look at bright colors. JESSEWhat?CELINEThat\u2019s what that shrink told me.  I was paying nine hundred francs an hour to hear that I was a homicidal maniac but I could perhaps shift my obsession if I would concentrate on bright colors. JESSEDid it work?CELINEI haven\u2019t killed him yet. EXT. STREET - NIGHT3131Walking along, they are engaged in an upbeat, lively debate.JESSEI mean, why is a man ultimately judged so harshly on the issue of fidelity?  You can be the best father and husband, you can be supportive and a great friend to your wife, but if you fuck around - uh-oh, we had it all wrong, you\u2019re really a loser.  I mean, there are these breeds of monkeys, and all they do is have sex all the time.  And they\u2019re the ones that are the most peaceful and the most happy.  What\u2019s so bad about fooling around?CELINEYou\u2019re talking about monkeys?50.JESSE (CONT'D)JESSEYeah.CELINESounds like a perfect male argument for justifying them fooling around.JESSEBut the women monkeys are fooling around too. CELINEYou know, I had this awful paranoid  thought that feminism was mostly invented by men so they could fuck around more.  Women, free your mind, free your body, sleep with me, we\u2019re all free and happy as long as I can fool around as much as I want...JESSEBut think about it.  If you had an island with ninety-nine women and one man, within a year you\u2019d have the possibility of ninety-nine babies.  If you had an island with ninety-nine men and one woman, after a year you\u2019d have the possibility of one baby. CELINEYes, and there\u2019d probably be only about forty-three men left because they would have killed each other.  And on the other island there would be ninety-nine women, ninety-nine babies, and no man because all the women would have gotten together and eaten him alive. JESSEThere\u2019s something to that, isn\u2019t there?  I think women don\u2019t mind killing men on some level.  Like, I was walking down the street once with my ex-girlfriend, and we pass these four thuggy guys leaning on a Camaro, and sure enough, one says, \u201cHey babe, nice ass.\u201d  I keep walking and I think, okay, have your fun, is it that big a deal?  I don\u2019t do anything.  I let it slide...51.CELINEPlus there were four of them.JESSEExactly.  So a few steps later, she turns and says, \u201cFuck you, dickheads.\u201d  I\u2019m thinking, wait a minute, they aren\u2019t going to come over and kick her ass.  Who\u2019s just been pushed to the front of the line on this one?  See, women say they hate it when you get all territorial and protective, but when it suits them, they tell you you\u2019re being all unmanly and a wimp.CELINEBut I don\u2019t think women want to kill men, and if they do, they rarely succeed.  I\u2019m sure men kill more women.  Anyway, this is depressing.  You know what? JESSELet\u2019s stop talking about this. CELINEYeah.  When you start talking about women and men, there\u2019s no end. JESSEI know - it\u2019s a skipping record.  People have been trying to figure it out for millenniums.  Every artist has tried their hand at it...CELINEAnd no one\u2019s come up with anything.INT. CAF\u00c9 - NIGHT3232After a series of tables of interesting people and hearing bits of conversations, we see Celine and Jesse sitting across from each other, talking for once. CELINEOkay.  Now I\u2019m calling my best friend in Paris, who I\u2019m supposed to have lunch with in about eight hours.  Drrr!  Drrr!  Ring!  Ring!    Pick up.52.JESSEWhat?CELINEPick up the phone. JESSEOh, right.  Hello?CELINEAllo, Vani.  C\u2019est Celine.  Comment \u00e7a va? JESSEBien, et toi?CELINEOh, tu sais ce qui n\u2019est arriv\u00e9... JESSEOkay, maybe we should do it in English.CELINEVanessa.  I\u2019m sorry I missed lunch, but I met a guy on the train and got off with him in Vienna.  We\u2019re still here. JESSEAre you crazy?CELINEProbably. JESSESo he\u2019s Austrian?  He lives there?CELINENo, no, he\u2019s just passing through here too.  He\u2019s American.  He goes home tomorrow morning.JESSESo why\u2019d you get off the train with him? CELINEHe convinced me, but I think I was ready after only talking to him a short while.  He was so sweet.  53.\n(MORE)We were in the lounge car and he began to talk about him as a little boy seeing his great-grandmother\u2019s ghost.  I think that\u2019s when I feel for him - just the idea of this little boy, full of dreams.  He trapped me. JESSEHmmm.CELINEAnd he\u2019s so cute.  He has really beautiful blue eyes, nice pink lips, and greasy hair.  He\u2019s kinda tall and a little clumsy.  I like to feel his eyes on me when I look away.  And he kind of kisses like an adolescent.  It\u2019s so cute. JESSEWhat?CELINEYeah, we kissed.  It was so adorable.  As the night went on I began to like him more and more.  But I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s scared of me.  I told him of my story about the woman killing her ex-boyfriend and stuff.  He must be thinking I\u2019m this manipulative, mean, dangerous woman.  I just hope he doesn\u2019t feel that way about me because - you know me - I\u2019m the most harmless person.  I just hide behind angriness because it\u2019s the only way I\u2019ve found to protect myself.  The only person I could ever really hurt is myself. JESSEI\u2019m sure he\u2019s not scared of you.  I\u2019m sure he\u2019s crazy about you. CELINEOkay, now it\u2019s your turn.  Call your friend. Jesse puts the phone up to his ear. JESSEBrrriiing.  I usually get this guy\u2019s answering machine. 54.CELINE (CONT'D)CELINEHey, dude, what\u2019s up?JESSEHey, Frank, you\u2019re there. CELINESo you\u2019re back?  How was Madrid?JESSEWell, it all pretty much sucked.  I\u2019m coming back a little early.  Jodie and I finally had our long overdue meltdown.  The long distance thing never seems to work, does it?  All my stupid, romantic projections.  Ugh.  I was actually only in Madrid a few days.  I had to get the hell out of there.  I\u2019ve been wandering around Europe for the last couple of weeks like an idiot.  I got a cheaper flight out of Vienna that didn\u2019t leave for a while, but it really wasn\u2019t that much cheaper.  I could have come right back, but I just couldn\u2019t.  I think I wanted to just wallow for a while.  I wanted to run, but not home.  I didn\u2019t want to see anyone I knew.  I didn\u2019t want to talk.  I wanted to be a ghost, completely anonymous. CELINEAre you okay?JESSEYeah, that\u2019s just it.  I\u2019m great...rapturous.  I\u2019m a real person again.  I\u2019ll tell you why.  It\u2019s my last night in Europe and I\u2019ve met someone very special.  You know how they say we are each other\u2019s angels and demons?  Well, she was literally this Botticelli angel, waiting for me at the gate back to life.CELINEWow...how did you meet?55.JESSEOn the train.  I actually saw her a couple of hours before we ever talked, as I was finding a seat.  She had her foot up on the seat across from her and didn\u2019t notice me at all as I passed by her.  Then later, there was this weirdo couple fighting near her, and she moved back and happened to sit right across the aisle from me.  We began to talk.  I don\u2019t think she really liked me at the beginning.  She is so smart and passionate and beautiful - I felt so unsure of myself.  I felt everything I was saying was stupid macho stuff. CELINEOh, man, I wouldn\u2019t worry.  I\u2019m sure she was not judging you.  And by the way, she decided to sit next to you.  I\u2019m sure she did it on purpose.  Us men are stupid.  We never understand women.  They act strange, the little I know of them. EXT. ALBERTINA LEDGE - NIGHT3333Celine and Jesse sit on the steps of a statue and observe the fairly constant activity around them.  A serious-looking guy walks by carrying a bag. JESSESee that guy?  We\u2019ll never see him again.  That was the one moment our lives intersect. The guy suddenly turns and walks back the other way. CELINEI always wonder about things like that.  Like, think of the bag he is carrying.  I wonder what is in it.  If you think he\u2019s carrying a bomb to blow up the opera because he failed his audition for Don Juan, then his serious expression becomes this angry, vicious face.  56.\n(MORE)But if you imagine in his bag is a present for his young, dying wife, then he becomes this poor, sympathetic character who you want to give a big hug to. JESSEHmmm.Celine indicates a young art-student-looking woman. CELINEShe\u2019s thinking about a TV show she saw yesterday on strippers, and even though all her friends were disgusted by it, she\u2019s thinking about giving up her low-paying office job and giving it a try. A nerdy guy walks by. JESSEThat guy over there...rejected by Scientology.  Actually flunked his free personality test - they had no use for him. EXT. ALBERTINA LEDGE - NIGHT3434They sit on the ledge overlooking the lit-up opera house.JESSEI feel like this is some dream world we\u2019re walking through. CELINEIt\u2019s so weird.  It\u2019s like our time together is just ours - it\u2019s our own creation.  It\u2019s like, I\u2019m in your dream and you\u2019re in mine. JESSEYeah, what we\u2019re doing this whole night shouldn\u2019t officially be happening. CELINEMaybe that\u2019s why this feels so other-worldly.(a beat)But then, the morning comes and we turn into pumpkins. 57.CELINE (CONT'D)JESSEAhh.  I don\u2019t want to talk about the morning. CELINEBut at this point I think you\u2019re supposed to produce the glass slipper and see if it fits. They both laugh. EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 3535They are on a large docked boat, the Johann Strauss, that serves as a restaurant.  They are sitting at a quiet outdoor table on the bow of the boat. JESSEAnd this older friend of mine said, at the birth of his child - it was a home birth and he was there helping out and everything - at that profound moment of birth, all he could think about was death.  That he was seeing something experience life for the first time, struggling for breath, and knowing that it was going to die someday.  He couldn\u2019t get it out of his head. CELINEI think that\u2019s why life is so interesting - because it\u2019s going to end. JESSEI know.  Death ups the ante being alive. CELINEIt\u2019s the same for us tonight, though.  If we knew we were going to see each other next week, it would not be the same energy, no?JESSEYeah, I know. CELINEDo you think we will see each other after tomorrow morning?58.JESSEI don\u2019t know.  What do you think?CELINEI asked you.JESSEHmmm.  I\u2019m thinking how...I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be in Europe again anytime soon.  Are you coming to the U.S. For any reason?Celine puts her head down on the table, depressed.CELINEOh, God, I don\u2019t want to get into the practical side of how we\u2019d see each other again.  Flying.  Let\u2019s be rational adults about this. JESSEOkay, uh, rational. CELINEWe should try something different. (a beat)It\u2019s not so bad if tonight is our only night.  Maybe it makes it really special. JESSEYeah, usually you exchange numbers and call each other once, maybe write each other once or twice...CELINEAnd then the slow fizzle.JESSEI hate that.CELINEThere was this famous writer - I don\u2019t remember who - who said the ideal relationship was two intense years, with clean breaks, fresh starts, friends for life, something like that.  It\u2019s like if you knew your relationship had to end in two years, there would be no room for fighting or wasted time.  There could be more love and appreciation for one another.  59.\n(MORE)It\u2019s like, if everyone you met you knew was going to die at midnight, you would be a much more compassionate person.  I mean, everyone\u2019s going to die, but since no one knows when, there\u2019s all the time in the world to be assholes to one another.  JESSEWhy do we think that relationships are supposed to last forever anyway, and that anything less is a failure?(a beat)But I hate the thought that we\u2019re just these ships passing in the night.  I think the only time I get depressed is when I feel that life is just this series of momentary connections.  I mean, of all the people you\u2019ve ever known, how many of them are still in your life in any way?  What happened to all the people you grew up with?  Miss Van Sickle, my bus driver in first grade - what\u2019s she up to?  What kind of life is she having? A wandering violin player has entered the room and is playing a waltz.CELINEBut for some people, there are no real good-byes.  I think if you have a meaningful experience with someone else, a true communication, they are with you forever in a way.  We are all a part of each other in ways we\u2019ll never know. JESSESo it\u2019s a deal?  We\u2019ll die in the morning? CELINEI think it\u2019s the only way.  I don\u2019t want to cheapen what\u2019s special about our time together.  If we push for something more, it\u2019s like we\u2019re trying to commodify ourselves or something.60.CELINE (CONT'D)JESSEOkay, no delusions.  No projections.  Let\u2019s just make the rest of tonight great. CELINEAnd it\u2019ll be ours forever. JESSEWe should do some kind of special handshake or something.CELINEOkay.They do a sort of handshake and then watch the violin player.EXT. ACTIVE STREET - NIGHT3636Celine and Jesse walk down a fairly busy street near some nightclubs.  They come across a crowd gathered around a woman dancing, and the rhythmic sound of finger cymbals can be heard.  Sitting on the ground is a man playing a dumbek who beats out a mesmerizing rhythm.  Celine grabs Jesse\u2019s arm with a look of excitement and rushes toward the crowd, finding a good vantage point to watch the Middle Eastern dancer.  The dancer performs in an exciting and unusual way and elicits a positive reaction from the crowd.  At the end of the performance Celine places a couple of bills in the tambourine that sits on the sidewalk near the dancer\u2019s shoes.  Then she and Jesse proceed down the street as the crowd disperses.  Celine is obviously moved by the dance.  CELINEI saw a documentary on that stuff - It\u2019s a birth dance. JESSEA birth dance?  How does that work?CELINEWomen used it when giving birth.  In some parts of the world they still do it.  The woman in labor enters a tent and the women of her tribe surround her and dance using their torsos and pelvises, and they encourage the birthing woman to dance with them so as to make the birth less painful.  And after the baby is born, they all dance in celebration. 61.JESSEWow.  My mom would have never gone for that. CELINEBut it\u2019s a really primal dance.  They think that women have usually done it mainly for other women as some kind of fertility ritual.JESSEThat\u2019s cool.CELINEIt\u2019s a beautiful thing.  I like the idea of dance as being a common function of life, something that everyone participates in. JESSEI know.  I heard about this old man watching a bunch of young people dancing.  He said, \u201cHow beautiful.  They are trying to shake off their genitals and become angels.\u201d(a beat)But, uh, just one question back there.  When the women are being all spiritual and dancing for the gods and themselves and stuff, where are the men?  Out food gathering?  Just not allowed?  See, Y\u2019all don\u2019t need us?CELINEMen are lucky we don\u2019t bite off their heads after mating.  Certain insects do that, you know - spiders and stuff.  We, at least, let you live.  What are you complaining about?She laughs as he jumps on her words. JESSEYou\u2019re officially kidding, but you keep bringing that up.  There is something to that. CELINE(interrupting)No, no, no.  Okay, speaking seriously here.  62.\n(MORE)I mean, I feel this pressure to be a strong and independent icon of womanhood and not have it look like my life is only revolving around some guy, but the love of a man and returning that love means a lot to me.  I always make fun of it and stuff, but isn\u2019t everything we\u2019re doing in life a way to be loved a little more or something?JESSESometimes I dream of being a good father and a good husband.  Sometimes that feels really close, but other times it just seems silly, and that it would ruin my life.  It\u2019s not that I have a fear of commitment or I\u2019m incapable of loving or caring about someone else, because I can.  It\u2019s just that if I\u2019m totally honest with myself, I\u2019d rather die knowing that I was really good at something, that I was special or had excelled in some way, than to have only been in a really nice, caring relationship.CELINEYou know, I had worked for this older man, and once he told me that he had spent all his life thinking about his career and his work, and how he was fifty-two and it suddenly struck him that he had never really given anything of himself, that his life was for no one and nothing.  He was almost crying saying this.(a beat)I really believe that if there\u2019s any kind of god, he wouldn\u2019t be in any one of us - not you, not me - but just this space in between.  If there\u2019s some magic in this world, it must be in the attempt of understanding someone else, sharing something, even if it\u2019s almost impossible to succeed.  But who cares - the answer must be in the attempt. 63.CELINE (CONT'D)INT. DANCE CLUB - NIGHT3737They enter a small, almost desolate disco where on couple is dancing and a few others are sitting around - the up-all-night crowd.  They split up and he goes over to the BARTENDER and starts talking to him, pleading with him.  She goes over to an empty table and subtly takes two glasses.  Across the room, he\u2019s made a little headway with the gruff, older bartender, who eventually relents and hands him a bottle of wine.  Suddenly Lou Christie\u2019s \u201cLightnin\u2019 Strikes\u201d comes over the speakers and Jesse hams it up as he crosses the dance floor on his way back to meet her at the door.  He tries to get into it and has a little success. EXT. PARK - NIGHT3838Later, they are sitting in a remote area of the park, pouring glasses from their bottle of wine. CELINESo often in my life I\u2019ve been with people and shared beautiful moments like traveling or staying up all night and watching the sunrise, and I knew it was a special moment, but something was always wrong.  I wished I\u2019d been with someone else.  I knew that what I was feeling - exactly what was so important to me - they didn\u2019t understand.  But I\u2019m happy to be with you.  You couldn\u2019t possibly know why a night like this is so important to my life right now, but it is.  I think this is a great morning. JESSEIt is a great morning. (a beat)Do you think we\u2019d have other mornings like this?CELINEWhat about our vow?JESSEYeah, I know.(a beat)I\u2019ve had those same feelings of wishing someone wasn\u2019t there, but I think it\u2019s myself I\u2019d like to get away from. 64.She looks up at him. JESSE (CONT\u2019D)I\u2019ve never been anywhere I haven\u2019t been.  I\u2019ve never had a kiss when I wasn\u2019t one of the kissers.  I\u2019ve never been to the movies when I wasn\u2019t in the audience or gone out bowling when I wasn\u2019t around making some stupid joke. She smiles, not really taking him seriously.JESSE (CONT\u2019D)No, really, I think that\u2019s why so many people hate themselves.  I mean if we got married, after a few years, you\u2019d hate a lot of my mannerisms, the way I drink a little too much when I\u2019m insecure, the way I tell the same ridiculous, pseudo-intellectual ideas to every couple we have over to dinner.  But you see, I\u2019ve already heard all my stupid stories, so of course I\u2019m sick of myself.  But our time here has been completely out of time.  Being with you has made me feel like I am someone else.  I haven\u2019t had my past around to constantly drown me.  The only other way to lose yourself like this is with drugs, or alcohol, dancing...stuff like that. CELINEFucking...He just looks up at her, smiling, a little surprised.JESSEYeah, fucking.CELINEDo you know what I want?JESSEWhat?CELINETo be kisses.JESSEI can do that.65.He gets up and kisses her, and tries to take it a little further. CELINEI have to say something stupid.JESSESure.CELINEIt\u2019s very stupid.JESSEOkay.CELINEI don\u2019t think we should sleep together.  I want to, but since we\u2019re not going to see each other again, it\u2019ll make me feel bad.  I\u2019ll wonder who else you\u2019re with.  I\u2019ll miss you.  I know it\u2019s not very adult...maybe it\u2019s a female thing...I can\u2019t help it. JESSEOkay, we\u2019ll see each other again.CELINENo.  I don\u2019t want you to break our vow just so you can get laid. JESSEI don\u2019t want to just get laid.  I want to have sex with you.  We\u2019re going to die in the morning, right?  I think we should.CELINENo.  Then it\u2019s like some male fantasy - meet a French girl on a train, fuck her, never see her again, and have a great story to tell.  I don\u2019t want to be a great story.  I don\u2019t want our great evening to have just been for that. JESSEOkay, let\u2019s not have sex. CELINEYou don\u2019t want to see me again?66.JESSENo, of course I do.  I mean, fuck, if I was asked right now to marry you or never see you again, I would marry you.  I mean, maybe that\u2019s a lot of romantic crap.  But people have gotten married for a lot less.  I think we\u2019d have as good a chance as anyone else.  Do you want to sleep with me?CELINEWell, actually I already decided to sleep with you when I got off the train.  Now that we\u2019ve talked so much I don\u2019t know anymore.  Why do I make everything so complicated?JESSEI don\u2019t know.They begin making out as we see the first light in the sky.EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING 3939They are walking along slowly, awkwardly, each a little in their own world. JESSEWhat\u2019s the first thing you\u2019re going to do when you get back to Paris?CELINECall my parents.  What about you?JESSEI will go pick up my dog.  He\u2019s with a buddy of mine. CELINEAhh.  I love dogs.JESSEOh, shit - we\u2019re back in real time. CELINEIt\u2019s awful.  I can\u2019t stand it. For the last few moments we\u2019ve been hearing the sound of a harpsichord far in the distance.JESSEDo you hear that?67.CELINEYeah...What is that...a harpsichord?JESSELet\u2019s go see where the hell that\u2019s coming from. They walk toward the baroque sounds.  As they get closer, the music gets louder.  They finally pinpoint the source.  Through a small street-level window they see a guy in a basement room playing away at his harpsichord.  The HARPSICHORD PLAYER\u2019s entire room is decorated in a seventeenth-to eightenth-century fashion with wood-plank floors, old furniture, and paintings.  Together with the beautiful and intense music, it is a stunning view - a living portrait.  They sort of look at each other occasionally but say nothing.  Celine and Jesse both begin to feel awkward at their Peeping Tom status now that the music is over, and they walk off quietly.  Jesse takes her hand. JESSE (CONT\u2019D)Can you dance to a harpsichord?CELINEI don\u2019t know.  Maybe.They dance a little on the sidewalk.EXT. ALBERTINA LEDGE - EARLY MORNING 4040They sit with their heads back on a bench, staring up at the early-morning clouds.CELINEWhen you talked earlier about after a few years how a couple would begin to hate each other by anticipating their reactions or getting tired of their mannerisms, I think it would be the opposite with me.  I think I can fall in love when I know everything about him - how he\u2019s going to part his hair, or what shirt he\u2019s going to wear that day, knowing the exact story he would tell in a given situation.  I\u2019m sure that\u2019s when I\u2019d know I\u2019m really in love. Jesse just smiles, looks at her, and then slowly looks back up at the sky. 68.JESSE(silly voice)The years shall run like rabbits...CELINEWhat?JESSENothing.  I have this great recording of Dylan Thomas reading this W.H. Auden poem.  He has this great voice.  It was like...(silly voice)\u201cBut all the clocks in the cityBegan to whirr and chime:O let not Time deceive you, You cannot conquer Time...\u201cIn headaches and in worryVaguely life leaks away,And Time will have his fancyTo-morrow or to-day.\u201dEXT. TRAIN STATION - DAWN4141She has retrieved her bag from the locker, and they are walking along the train toward her car.  They seem vulnerable, even shy, as they both finally face the inevitable.CELINESo you know what bus you\u2019re taking to the airport?JESSEYeah, no problem.CELINEI guess this is it, no?JESSEYep.  I really...you know.CELINEI know.  Me too.(a beat)You lied to me, you know.JESSEWhat do you mean?69.CELINEYou told me that our time together would someday make me happier with my future husband, but now I\u2019ll wonder even more.Neither says anything for an extended moment.CELINE (CONT\u2019D)Be happy, okay?  Work hard and have fun with everything you\u2019re doing. JESSEI will.  And good luck with school and everything.(a beat)I hate this.CELINEI know.  I think the train is about to leave. They look into each other\u2019s eyes.  Jesse reaches out for Celine\u2019s hand and clasps it tightly.  They smile, knowing that they\u2019ve changed in unexpected ways, and then embrace tenderly for several moments.  They part, and Celine turns suddenly and walks up the stairs to her train car.  As she reaches the top step she hesitates, turns, and looks back and Jesse, who\u2019s still staring at her.  He signals for her to hold on a second.JESSEHey, everything we were saying is bullshit.  This is all stupid - I don\u2019t want to do it. She laughs.JESSE (CONT\u2019D)And I didn\u2019t lie to you.  I\u2019ll prove it. CELINEYeah?JESSEI\u2019ll come with you.Celine is almost laughing.CELINENo.  You\u2019ll drive me crazy.  You don\u2019t speak French.  I\u2019d have to completely take care of you.  70.\n(MORE)It would be a big mistake. (a beat)But perhaps we should meet in five years.JESSEYeah, think so?  Five years?CELINENo, no.  Five years is too long.  It would be more like a sociology experiment.  How about one year?JESSEYes, one year.  One year?  How about six months?CELINEBut it will be freezing.JESSEOkay, we can meet here and then go somewhere else.CELINEOkay.  But is that six months from now or last night?JESSELast night.  Okay.  Six months from last night.  December sixteenth, six o\u2019clock in the evening, track eleven.  It\u2019s a train ride for you, but I got to fly over.  But, hey, I\u2019ll be here. CELINEGood.  And we\u2019re not going to write or call or anything right?JESSERight.  But six months. They laugh at themselves and give a quick kiss before parting.CELINEGood-bye.JESSEBye.They part and Celine disappears into the train. 71.CELINE (CONT'D)INT/EXT. MORNING MONTAGE4242Celine finds her way to a seat.  Jesse gets his stuff out of his locker and begins walking.  As her train slowly pulls out of the station, we hear the harpsichord and see a series of shots of many of the locations Celine and Jesse inhabited the night before.  In the early-morning light these places are now somehow different.  Even though there is little human presence at this time of the morning, the transformation has begun.  We see Jesse getting situated on his bus to the airport.  We then see the park where they danced, sang, and stared up at the sky.  A very old lady walks slowly across the grass.  Celine is settled on the train and reading.  She looks up from her book and just stares out the window at the landscape going by. FADE OUT.72.",

Anybody who talks about California hedonism has never spent a Christmas in Sacramento. - Joan Didion   INT. MOTEL. CALIFORNIA. EARLY MORNING.  One of those anonymous trucker motels along-side I-5 through central California. It\u2019s late summer, 2002. Two women sleep together in a bed. Christine, aka Lady Bird, 17 years old. Her Mom, Marion, the age of Lady Bird\u2019s Mom. A modern-day romantic Mary Cassatt rip-off painting of motherhood.  LADY BIRD (V.O.) Do you think I look like I\u2019m from Sacramento? CUT TO:  Now they\u2019re awake. Lady Bird stares at her re. Marion makes the bed. MARION You are from Sacramento. LADY BIRD (re: making the bed) You don\u2019t have to do that. MARION Well it\u2019s nice to make things neat and clean.  Marion is making hospital corners. Lady Bird sits on the just made bed. Marion sits beside her, moves the hair out of Lady Bird\u2019s eyes. MARION (CONT\u2019D) Ready to go home? LADY BIRD Ready. INT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. CALIFORNIA. DAY. The last sentences of The Grapes of Wrath. AUDIOBOOK \u201cHer hand moved behind his head and supported it. Her fingers moved gently in his hair. She looked up and across the barn, and her lips came together and smiled mysteriously.\u201d You have been listening to \u2018The Grapes of Wrath\u2019 by John Steinbeck. If you... (pause)  2.    Lady Bird ejects the tape, returns it to the case from the public library. They are both crying. LADY BIRD (looking on the back) Our college trip took 21 hours and 5 minutes.  They laugh and then wipe their tears. It\u2019s a nice moment - they both had the same emotion. Lady Bird immediately starts looking for a good song on the radio. MARION (turning it off) Hey, you know, let\u2019s just sit with what we heard? LADY BIRD (bristling) Are you serious? MARION We don\u2019t need to be constantly entertaining ourselves, do we? Lady Bird stares out the window, now sullen. Then: LADY BIRD I wish I could live through something.  MARION Aren\u2019t you? LADY BIRD Nope. The only exciting thing about 2002 is that it\u2019s a palindrome.  MARION Ok fine, yours is the worst life of all, you win.   LADY BIRD Oh so now you\u2019re mad? Because I wanted to listen to music? MARION It\u2019s just that you\u2019re being ridiculous, you have a great life. LADY BIRD I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not perfect. MARION Nobody is asking you to be perfect! Just considerate would do. 3.    LADY BIRD (really picking a fight) I don\u2019t even want to go to school in this state anyway, I hate California. I want to go to the East Coast. MARION Your Dad and I will barely be able to afford in-state tuition. LADY BIRD There are loans, scholarships! MARION Your brother, your very smart brother, can\u2019t even find a job -- LADY BIRD He and Shelly work. They have jobs. MARION THEY BAG AT THE GROCERY STORE. That is not a career and they went to BERKELEY.MARION Your father\u2019s company is laying people off right and left, did you know that? No of course not because you don\u2019t care about anyone but yourself. MARION Immaculate Heart is already a luxury.  LADY BIRD Immaculate FART. You wanted that, not me!  MARION Miguel saw someone knifed in front of him at Sac High, is that what you want? You\u2019re telling me that you want to see someone knifed right in front of you? 4.    LADY BIRD He barely saw that. I want to go where culture is, like New York.   MARION How in the world did I raise such a SNOB?  MARION  LADY BIRD Or at least Connecticut or New Hampshire. Where writers live in the woods. You couldn\u2019t get into those schools anyway.   MOM! LADY BIRD  MARION You can\u2019t even pass your driver\u2019s test.  LADY BIRD Because you wouldn\u2019t let me practice enough! MARION The way you work, the way you don\u2019t work, you\u2019re not even worth state tuition, Christine.  LADY BIRD MY NAME IS LADY BIRD!   LADY BIRD MARION (CONT'D) Well actually, it\u2019s not, and it\u2019s ridiculous. Your name is Christine. CALL ME LADY BIRD LIKE YOU SAID YOU WOULD!  MARION You should just go to City College, with your work ethic. City College and then to jail then back to City College. Maybe you\u2019d learn how to pull yourself up and not expect everyone to do everything for you...  They slow for a stop light and Lady Bird dramatically opens the door and rolls out of the car. Marion screams. 5.    INT. IMMACULATE HEART OF MARY. DAY.  Close on a cast. In very small letters is written \u201cfuck you, mom.\u201d The cast belongs to Lady Bird. She follows along with the mass.  CREDITS run over this joint liturgy between Immaculate Heart of Mary (girls school) and Xavier (boys school) and beginning of the year activities.  A sea of catholic girls\u2019 school uniforms in bleachers during candidate speeches.  CANDIDATE (finishing her speech) A Vote for Amanda is a vote for boys. Boys and healthy vending machines because no one wants a muffin with that many calories.  Lady Bird waits her turn to make her speech, and makes eye contact with Julie in the crowd, a sweet, chubby 17 year old. Her best friend.   5 classrooms, 5 syllabi, 5 \u201cbeginning of senior year\u201d speeches from the teachers. A few teachers are nuns. SISTER SARAH-JOAN There are the classics: St. Augustine, of course, and Aquinas. My favorite, Kierkegaard - wait until you hear his love story - it will make you swoon. Back in the church, Lady Bird looks intently at an image of Jesus. The priest gives his homily. PRIEST We\u2019re afraid we won\u2019t get into the college of our choice, we\u2019re afraid we won\u2019t be loved, we won\u2019t be liked, we won\u2019t succeed.  Everyone takes communion. Lady Bird approaches and crosses her arms so she just gets a blessing, not real communion, she\u2019s not Catholic. Lady Bird watches the boys get communion. It\u2019s somehow sexy, opening their mouths to receive the wafer. SISTER SARAH-JOAN (V.O.) Some of the students were disturbed by your posters. 6.    INT. VICE-PRINCIPAL SISTER SARAH-JOAN\u2019S OFFICE. DAY.  Sister Sarah-Joan, in a traditional habit, holds up some of Lady Bird\u2019s campaign materials. LADY BIRD It\u2019s just a bird head on a lady body or vice versa. SISTER SARAH-JOAN I think it\u2019s a little upsetting...  Reveal of the poster: Lady Bird\u2019s head on a bird body. Another shows her Catholic-uniformed body with a bird head. LADY BIRD It\u2019s my tradition to run for office. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t win. SISTER SARAH-JOAN That\u2019s not what I\u2019m worried about. LADY BIRD (worried) This won\u2019t mess with my scholarship, will it? SISTER SARAH-JOAN No, you\u2019re okay there. (trying to be helpful) You have a performative streak, I think.  LADY BIRD I think that too. SISTER SARAH-JOAN Maybe you\u2019d enjoy theatre arts... They are having auditions for the fall musical. LADY BIRD Do we have that here? SISTER SARAH-JOAN It\u2019s a collaborative effort with the men at Xavier. LADY BIRD How am I a senior and not know we have that? 7.    SISTER SARAH-JOAN Perhaps you haven\u2019t always been an active part of this community. SISTER SARAH-JOAN They do a fall musical and a spring play and from what I hear it\u2019s a real blast. LADY BIRD What I\u2019d really like is to be on Math Olympiad. SISTER SARAH-JOAN (gently) But math isn\u2019t something that you are terribly strong in? LADY BIRD That we know of YET. CLOSE ON A LIST.  Sign ups for auditions for the fall musical. A hand reaches up and takes the pen attached and writes, in all caps: CHRISTINE \u201cLADY BIRD\u201d McPHERSON And then another hand reaches up and writes: JULIANNE \u201cJULIE\u201d PICKETT LADY BIRD (O.S.) \u201cJulie\u201d doesn\u2019t need to be in quotes.  JULIE (O.S.) But it\u2019s not my real name. Reveal Julie and Lady Bird debating this: LADY BIRD It\u2019s not the same thing.  JULIE (shaking her head) I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re right... 8.    EXT. SACRAMENTO STREETS. LATE AFTERNOON.  Julie and Lady Bird walk through the \u201cfancy\u201d neighborhood, \u201cThe Fabulous Forties.\u201d They stop in front of this very specific house - it is the Dream House: It is three stories and blue, with white shutters and a big American Flag. It looks like nothing bad would ever happen in this house. JULIE I love this neighborhood. LADY BIRD Yeah, it\u2019s so beautiful. JULIE If I lived here I would definitely have my wedding in the backyard. LADY BIRD I\u2019d have friends over all the time to study and eat snacks. I\u2019d be like \u201cMOM WE\u2019RE TAKING THE SNACKS UPSTAIRS TO THE TV ROOM.\u201d JULIE I\u2019d have my own bathroom. INT. GROCERY STORE. EARLY EVENING.  Julie and Lady Bird browse magazines in an empty checkout aisle. A Checker calls out to them: CHECKER I can\u2019t stop you dicks from hanging out here but quit wrinkling all the magazines!  LADY BIRD When I\u2019m in this store, I\u2019m not your sister - I\u2019m a customer, Miguel! I\u2019m always right!  This is Miguel. Lady Bird\u2019s brother. 22, Latino, clearly adopted. Julie watches him and his girlfriend, Shelly Yuhan, 22, a Bagger:  JULIE Ever since she moved in, your brother and Shelly are becoming the same person. LADY BIRD No way. 9.    Shelly and Miguel have the same asymmetrical hair-cut and \u201cinteresting\u201d piercings. Vaguely punk looking. Seem like they\u2019re wearing black leather jackets even when they aren\u2019t. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Yeah, okay, maybe. JULIE (re: magazine) See, why I don\u2019t look like that?  The girls look at a model in the magazine. She poses in front of the New York City skyline. LADY BIRD Just once I\u2019d like to have the song \u201cNew York Groove\u201d play and feel like it really applies to my life. JULIE You\u2019ve never even been to New York. LADY BIRD That\u2019s why I\u2019m applying to New York colleges - do you know if Sarah Lawrence is actually IN the city? JULIE Your parents would pay for that? LADY BIRD Scholarships, financial aid. I\u2019ll figure it out. My Mom thinks I can\u2019t get in but she is sorely mistaken.  JULIE What about terrorism? LADY BIRD Don\u2019t be a Republican. JULIE I\u2019m probably just going to go to City College. MIGUEL (almost yelling)  PUT THE MAGAZINE BACK.SHIT. INT. PSYCH HOSPITAL. EARLY MORNING. Marion yawns. Luis, a large Filipino man, approaches her: 10.    LUIS You doing okay, mama? MARION Yes, but that was terrifying wasn\u2019t it? Thank god you were there. I guess I can\u2019t have pencils anymore.  LUIS Yeah, gotta go back to just felt tip markers. Crayola.  Marion suddenly remembers she has something, she hand Luis a small bag:  MARION Oh Luis this is for you! I got it for the baby, I couldn\u2019t resist it.  He pulls out a frilly pink dress for a toddler. LUIS She loves pink! MARION Well, it\u2019s really more for you and Andrea than it is for the baby, and I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t have time to wrap it.... LUIS No, it\u2019s perfect. MARION See you tomorrow... I mean, later? Luis just laughs. INT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. EARLY MORNING.  Marion drives back home. It is romantic somehow. She loves these streets, loves the turns she knows so well. When she\u2019s not resenting the stuck-ness of her own life she has an enormous capacity to love it. Remember this moment with Marion. EXT. LADY BIRD\u2019S NEIGHBORHOOD. EARLY MORNING.  Marion drives up. Women are watering their lawns, getting the paper, doing yard work, touching their flowers. Solidly middle class. Marion waves to neighbors. They wave back. She picks up the mail, bills, papers, etc. 11.    INT. BATHROOM. MORNING.  Dad (50s, name: Larry) brushes his teeth. Marion perched on the edge of the tub with a newspaper and a stack of mail, going through it.  LARRY Did you know toothpaste is basically ineffective? It\u2019s like sucking on a mint. MARION (to Larry, shaking her head) Mike Kerry died. I didn\u2019t know he was sick again. LARRY How old was he? MARION Only fifty-six. Knocking at the door. MIGUEL (O.S.) Can Shelly and I get in there? MARION In a minute honey Dad and I are still in here! LARRY (re: Mike) That\u2019s too young. MARION (calling) LADY BIRD YOU BETTER BE DRESSED!  LADY BIRD I AM DRESSED.  MARION (CONT\u2019D) I\u2019ll send them a note. (a little softer) Do you think that Shelly and Miguel have sex on the pullout couch? 12.    LARRY Oh yeah.  Marion laughs at Larry\u2019s subtle joke. He laughs at her laughter. They like each other. INT. KITCHEN. MORNING.  Miguel and Shelly eat cereal. Larry reads the paper. Marion makes Lady Bird\u2019s breakfast and her lunch. LADY BIRD Why can\u2019t I just make the eggs? MARION Because you take too long and make a big mess and then I have to clean it up. SHELLY (small voice) Eggs aren\u2019t good for the environment, anyway. LADY BIRD (too loud) WHAT?  MIGUEL You heard her. MARION (placing the eggs) Here, eat quickly, PLEASE. LARRY (re: paper) Look at all these pictures. Every newspaper looks like USA Today.  MIGUEL Shelly and I are trying to be vegan. Hence the soy milk. LADY BIRD You wear leather jackets. 13.    SHELLY They\u2019re vintage. It doesn\u2019t support the industry. LADY BIRD (poking at the eggs) They aren\u2019t done, there\u2019s white stuff.  SHELLY You know how you love Brambles? Pigs are smarter than him even. LADY BIRD I never thought Brambles was a GENIUS okay?   LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) (very obnoxious) MOM! The eggs are NOT DONE! MARION FINE MAKE YOUR OWN FUCKING EGGS.  Marion then throws the frying pan violently in the sink and retreats to the bathroom. The noisy hair-dryer starts up. LADY BIRD I WANTED TO YOU WON\u2019T LET ME! Lady Bird follows Marion out of the room. SHELLY Your sister doesn\u2019t like me. LADY BIRD (O.S.)  MOM!!! I\u2019M HUNGRY!   MIGUEL She does.  Shelly gets up, pouting. MIGUEL follows her   MARION (O.S.) YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE! GOING TO BED! 14.   Larry is left alone. It\u2019s weirdly peaceful for half a second. INT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. DAY. Lady Bird and Larry on the way to school. She feverishly changes the radio station, finds a song she likes: LADY BIRD Did you know that Alanis Morisette wrote this song in only ten minutes?  LARRY I believe it. LADY BIRD (she smiles) So I\u2019m applying to a couple East Coast schools. I need you to help me with the financial aid application but Mom can\u2019t know. LARRY We... aren\u2019t they quite expensive?  LADY BIRD First, yes that\u2019s why financial aid. Second, I have to get in first.  LARRY Mom won\u2019t be happy about it. LADY BIRD Which is why I don\u2019t want to fight about it before I have to. 15.    Lady Bird looks up. They are a couple of blocks from school. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Just pull over here LARRY Are you sure, I can drive you to the front -- LADY BIRD No, just this is fine. I like to walk.  LARRY Okay, well, I love you. LADY BIRD So what do you think? About college?  LARRY I\u2019ll see what I can do. LADY BIRD (kisses him on the cheek) Thanks Dad, love you too. Have a good day at work. LARRY Hey, I\u2019m like Keith Richards \u201cI\u2019m just happy to be anywhere.\u201d  She gets out quickly and hurries away. She\u2019s almost at school when Julie pulls up.  JULIE (calling out) Hey bitch!   Ms. Pickett has VERY LARGE fake breasts. Her boyfriend, Matt, hands a sack lunch to Lady Bird and Julie. MATT Alright girls, hope you like pickles. 16.    JULIE Thanks, Uncle Matt. LADY BIRD Sweet! Ms. Pickett gets in the driver\u2019s seat, they drive away. LADY BIRD He\u2019s not your uncle. JULIE It\u2019s something I\u2019m trying out. Bye, mom.   (watching Ms. Pickett go) Your Mom really likes you. JULIE Yeah. I just keep getting fatter.   Lady Bird starts eating the Matt lunch and chucks her own lunch into a garbage can. The one her Mom spent time making. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) (mouth full) Me too. Matt is awesome.  JULIE Yeah, I hope he marries my Mom. That would be nice. He promised me his old car when I turn eighteen.  In the student parking lot, a girl gets out of her fancy Range Rover. She\u2019s pretty in a high school way. LADY BIRD That car should be illegal. Jenna Walton\u2019s not doing any off-roading. She just goes to Pavillions. JULIE I heard Jenna Walton has a tanning bed in her house.  The girl, Jenna Walton, is very tan. Identical tan girls descend on her.  LADY BIRD She is so pretty.  JULIE Her skin is luminous.   LADY BIRD Maybe we should try tanning. 17.    INT. VESTMENT ROOM. DAY  Lady Bird and Julie sit with their legs up the wall, eating communion wafers out of a large plastic container. LADY BIRD Yeah, in the tub I just scoot myself under like now, like this, and then the water just...  She gestures, showing that the water would flow into her crotch and get her off. They are hysterically laughing. JULIE We are so gross! LADY BIRD I think I figured it out when I was like three or something. JULIE I use, I take off the shower head, oh god this is so embarrassing! I use that.  LADY BIRD I don\u2019t know if mine is the right kind, though. Maybe it\u2019s different when you actually have a penis in there, like it\u2019s more intense. JULIE Mine is pretty intense, I think. Darlene, an odd looking girl, has silently walked in. DARLENE You\u2019re not supposed to eat the wafers!  JULIE (trying to be helpful) They aren\u2019t consecrated.  Darlene turns on her heel, annoyed. Lady Bird and Julie dissolve into giggles. INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. DAY.  Lady Bird, wearing an extreme \u201caudition\u201d dress, and Julie, in her uniform, sit and watch other students perform. 18.    Father Leviatch runs auditions - there is something funny and depressed about him. An overweight woman, Miss Patty, accompanies on the piano when needed. A boy, Greg, is up. He has a big voice for such a tiny boy: GREG \u201cBEING ALIVVEEEEEEEEEE......!\u201d Cut to Father Leviatch calling out from his clipboard: FATHER LEVIATCH Okay, Christine? LADY BIRD Lady Bird. FATHER LEVIATCH Is that your given name? LADY BIRD Yes. FATHER LEVIATCH Why is it in quotes? LADY BIRD Well I gave it to myself. It\u2019s given. To me, by me. FATHER LEVIATCH OK, take it away, Lady Bird. Cut to Lady Bird singing her song. LADY BIRD \u201cEverybody says don\u2019t / Everybody says don\u2019t / Everybody says don\u2019t it isn\u2019t right, don\u2019t it isn\u2019t niiiiiceeee / Everybody says don\u2019t / Everybody says don\u2019t / Everybody says don\u2019t walk on the grass....\u201d Cut to Julie, wearing her uniform, shy and nervous: JULIE (singing) \u201cMake me a channel of your peace / where there\u2019s despair in life let me bring hope / where there is darkness only light / and where there\u2019s sadness ever joy....\u201d  Julie has a sweet, clear, beautiful voice. It\u2019s a quiet moment and everyone pays attention. 19.    More girls and more boys. Now most everyone is done.  Danny stands. He\u2019s very handsome. Strapping, even. He gives his sheet music to the Miss Patty. Then he sings: DANNY (singing) \u201cThere are giants in the sky! / There are big tall terrible giants in the sky! When you\u2019re way up high and you look below at the world you\u2019ve left and the things you know little than a glance is enough to show you just how small you are!\u201d  He\u2019s AMAZING. Julie and Lady Bird look at each other. DREAM BOAT CITY. INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S ROOM. NIGHT.  Underneath her window sill by her bed, Lady Bird writes the name: DANNY.  She\u2019s in love and want to make it permanent somewhere. Suddenly, a voice is directed right at Lady Bird\u2019s door: MARION (O.S.) I CAN SEE THE LIGHT ON IN YOUR ROOM GO TO BED! Lady Bird shuts off her light and sleeps, dreaming of Danny. EXT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. DAY Lady Bird and Julie check the casting list. They first find: MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG Franklin Shepard: Danny O\u2019Neill, Charlie Kringus: Greg Anrue Gussie: Diana Greenway, Beth: Julie Steffans. They move way down the list until they find: Swing/Chorus: Christine McPherson LADY BIRD (tightly) Congratulations. JULIE You too! We both got in! 20.    LADY BIRD Everyone who auditioned got in. The part I got was basically not getting in. JULIE (trying to downplay) I do not even know how I got cast in my part. LADY BIRD Me neither. I was the one who had a dress and prepared a song. JULIE I know! LADY BIRD (thinking) Now you\u2019re going to get romantic with Danny on stage. JULIE It\u2019s probably my only shot at that, you know? LADY BIRD  She take the pen and crosses out Christine and writes LADY BIRD. Leaves.  Julie stays and when she\u2019s sure she\u2019s alone she touches her name - loving herself and the feeling of being chosen. INT. GROCERY STORE. EARLY EVENING. Marion grocery shops. Lady Bird looks at a BRIDE magazine. LADY BIRD Mom... MARION (re: the magazine) We don\u2019t need to buy that. LADY BIRD It\u2019s only three dollars. I\u2019m having a hard week. MARION If you want to read it we can go to the public library. LADY BIRD I want to read it in bed. 21.   MARION That\u2019s something rich people do. We are not rich people.  Lady Bird walks away and then tucks the magazine underneath her sweater into the top of her skirt, sneakily stealing it.  As she\u2019s performing this maneuver, she sees DANNY (!) and his Mom and three little brothers walk by. She walks up bravely: LADY BIRD Hey! DANNY Hi. LADY BIRD Come here often? DANNY (not getting the joke) Excuse me?  LADY BIRD (extending her hand) I\u2019m Lady Bird, we\u2019re going to be in the musical together. DANNY Oh, yeah, I remember you! You were wearing that dress. LADY BIRD I just wanted to say what\u2019s up and I\u2019ll see you in rehearsal. DANNY Thanks, I\u2019m super excited. You live in the neighborhood? LADY BIRD (doing a voice) Nah, I\u2019m from the wrong side of the tracks.  DANNY What?  LADY BIRD Is that your family? There are so many of you! DANNY Irish-Catholic! It\u2019s hard to find a girl to date that\u2019s not my cousin. 22.    LADY BIRD (flustered) Well, okay. You\u2019re going to make a great Franklin. DANNY Thanks! I want my hair, his hair to be curly, though.   Yeah! LADY BIRD  DANNY Like Jim Morrison. Very \u201970s. LADY BIRD Like Jim Morrison exactly. DANNY\u2019S MOM DANNY!  Gotta go!  DANNY  Lady Bird walks back to Marion, who is with Miguel while he scans their groceries and Shelly bags them. LADY BIRD Who is Jim Morrison again? MIGUEL He was in a rock band, moron, The Doors.  LADY BIRD I knew that. MARION (looking at the bill) This is with your employee discount?  MIGUEL Yeah, it\u2019s already included. Marion looks worried. INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. AFTERNOON.  Everyone tries to keep up with the dance steps Miss Patty teaches them. She is also, apparently, the choreographer. She can move amazingly well for a bigger woman. 23.    They play theatre games and do acting exercises. Father Leviatch is actually quite good at casting a spell and making everyone feel included.  CUT TO:  The priest, Father Leviatch, looks around the stage where everyone sits, cross legged, tired from dancing. FATHER LEVIATCH To get our emotions going, we\u2019re going to play \u201cfirst one to cry wins.\u201d  FATHER LEVIATCH Starting ... Now. I\u2019m playing too. So is Miss Patty. Miss Patty nods.  They all try to cry really hard. Suddenly everyone looks up - Father Leviatch is sobbing. Everyone is uncomfortable watching an adult man cry.  FATHER LEVIATCH I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. EXT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. AFTERNOON. Diana, another girl in the play, dishes the gossip while she and Lady Bird and Danny wait for their rides: DIANA I heard that before he became a priest he was married and he had a son named Etienne who died of a drug overdose at 17 which was maybe a suicide but my mom says same difference if you are so careless with your life. (a horn honks) Oh that\u2019s her! Gotta go, bye guys!  Lady Bird and Danny wave goodbye and then fall into a semi- awkward silence. She sees it\u2019s her Moment. She tries to casually hand Danny a bag but it\u2019s a kind of big bag. 24.    LADY BIRD Oh, I almost forgot. I brought you these hot rollers. For your Jim Morrison hair. He pulls out the Conair pink and purple \u201cHot Sticks.\u201d DANNY Thank you so much.  LADY BIRD You\u2019re welcome.  DANNY You\u2019ll have to show me how to use them. LADY BIRD (weirdly formal) It would be my pleasure. DANNY They look like sperms.  He laughs and Lady Bird joins in. They do look like sperms but it wasn\u2019t so funny to say it. DANNY (CONT\u2019D) Hey! I just remembered I had a dream about you! LADY BIRD Really?! What happened? DANNY We were flying to Disneyland on a giant carrot.... LADY BIRD Awesome! DANNY I love Disneyland. LADY BIRD Me too, I think it\u2019s kind of scary but I also love it. Triumph! They are having a Real Conversation. INT. ALGEBRA II CLASS. DAY Mr. Bruno explains a problem on a projector. He\u2019s handsome and young-ish. Definitely handsome for an all girls school. Lady Bird zones out, thinking about Danny. Julie looks intently at Mr. Bruno. She loves him, privately. 25.    MR. BRUNO (finishing an explanation) Don\u2019t leave me hanging. Can I get a nod? That\u2019s good. Maybe even a verbal confirmation? JULIE (too loud) YES.  Julie experience her mini moment of private embarrassment. They are handed back quizzes. Julie gets a A-. MR. BRUNO Good job, Jules, I could tell from your work that you even understood the one you missed! He kind of winks at her. She blushes. LADY BIRD (looking at her grade) SUCK A DICK. JULIE (to Lady Bird) I like \u201cJules.\u201d Lady Bird looks at her C+. LADY BIRD I just don\u2019t get why I\u2019m not good at math, my Dad is really good at math. Even Miguel has a math degree.  JULIE Maybe it\u2019s your Mom\u2019s fault. INT. HOMECOMING DANCE. SCHOOL GYM. NIGHT.  There are a bunch of kids clumped, some dancing, some sitting on half-hearted hay bales. The popular girls, Jenna etc., wear tank tops that say (front) Ditch the horse... (and back) Ride the cowboy!  Lady Bird and Julie now have on bandanas and denim - they\u2019re doing the Groucho Marx Duck Soup dance to \u201cTha Crossroads.\u201d Suddenly Lady Bird stops. JULIE You lose! POINT JULIE! LADY BIRD No, look26.  Across the dance, there is Danny. He\u2019s wearing chaps, a holster, a hat, fake pistols. Like teenage John Wayne. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Wish me luck. JULIE Luck. Julie watches as Lady Bird makes a bee-line for Danny. LADY BIRD Wanna dance? DANNY Hell, yeah!  They start slow dancing together. Julie does the duck-soup dance alone and then stops. It\u2019s pointless without a buddy. She falls back and watches. Sister Sarah-Joan walks by Lady Bird and Danny: SISTER SARAH-JOAN Six inches for the Holy Spirit!  They roll their eyes: Rules! Once she leaves Danny pulls Lady Bird close again. She swoons. Life is happening. EXT. SCHOOL GYM. NIGHT.  Lady Bird, Julie and Danny wait outside of the dance, leaning against the gym waiting for their parents. Julie\u2019s Mom pulls up with Uncle Matt. Honks. JULIE (to Lady Bird) That\u2019s us!  LADY BIRD Nah, my Mom is coming. JULIE No she\u2019s not. LADY BIRD (pointed) Yes, she is. JULIE But the plan was sleepover at - LADY BIRD IT\u2019S FINE. 27.    Lady Bird is clearly trying to stay there with Danny. JULIE (annoyed) Okay, bye then.  Julie gets in the front seat to practice driving. Leaves. Lady Bird and Danny are quiet, listening to the muffled sounds of the dance. Then: DANNY Have you ever been out of the country?  LADY BIRD When I was little, my Dad had a job that took him to Brazil. I remember from the pictures. DANNY I\u2019ve never been out of the country. It\u2019s my dream to go to Paris.  LADY BIRD (sighs) Paris. DANNY That\u2019s why I\u2019m learning French. LADY BIRD My mom said French wasn\u2019t useful. DANNY It is if you want to go to Paris. They laugh.  DANNY (CONT\u2019D) I still don\u2019t know how to use those rollers you gave me. LADY BIRD Oh, it\u2019s so easy, like after they heat up, you just take your hair and twist the hair and then twirl the thing like this...  She reaches up to his hair. He kisses her. It\u2019s surprising. They kiss again. It\u2019s romantic, really romantic. EXT. SACRAMENTO STREETS. NIGHT.  Lady Bird walks home. She\u2019s smiling so huge and throws her face to the sky and screams. INT. HOUSE. NIGHT. 28.   Marion and Larry are arguing with a lot of financial documents strewn across the kitchen table. 29.    MARION Larry how long will this hold us. LARRY I don\u2019t know...  Lady Bird opens the back door, glowing and shiny from the night and the kiss. She sneaks past. MARION Well, someone must know. Can the whole family go on Cobra, even Miguel? What happens if someone gets in an accident? LARRY I\u2019m not sure - the severance package I think it expires all at once, not within the calendar year...  Lady Bird tip-toes into her room. She knows she wasn\u2019t supposed to see this. And she doesn\u2019t want to know any more. MARION I\u2019ll ask at my work if -- Suddenly, a noise makes her turn her head sharply. MARION (CONT\u2019D) Is she home? LARRY Maybe leave it for tonight... MARION No, she knows better. (getting up) She cannot sneak around like this... Marion barrels down the hallway towards Lady Bird\u2019s room. INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. Lady-Bird, under the covers, hears her Mom coming. Then all the lights come on, it\u2019s so bright: MARION Christine! You can\u2019t leave your room like this! LADY BIRD I didn\u2019t... 30.  MARION None of these things were put away right, they aren\u2019t nice, CHRISTINE! NOW! LADY BIRD (weakly) My name is Lady Bird.  MARION Don\u2019t lie to me, Christine!  Lady Bird sees her Dad pass by the door and give her a look like \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t help you here.\u201d He disappears. Marion picks up her uniform. MARION NO, this uniform is going to look like TRASH on Monday! MARION (CONT\u2019D) This isn\u2019t right - we can\u2019t treat our clothes like this. I don\u2019t know what your wealthy friends do... LADY BIRD Why do you care what I do to my clothes?  Marion closes the door..  MARION Your father does not have a job. MARION He lost his job, okay? Do you need him to come in here and explain that to you? 30.    MARION Of course he wouldn\u2019t do it anyway, he\u2019s Mr. Nice Guy. I always have to be the Bad Guy.  LADY BIRD Can we please talk about this tomorrow?  MARION You can\u2019t look like a rag because that makes us look like rags. And you want to know the truth? Here\u2019s the truth: some of your friends\u2019 fathers could employ your father and they won\u2019t do that if it looks like his family is trash. Lady Bird puts all her clothes away while Marion watches. LADY BIRD (quietly) Didn\u2019t you ever go to sleep without putting all your clothes away perfectly? Like even once? And don\u2019t you wish your Mom hadn\u2019t gotten angry? MARION My mother was an abusive alcoholic. Lady Bird has nothing to say to this, Marion wins. INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR\u2019S OFFICE. DAY. Lady Bird looks at some brochures. The Guidance Counselor looks at her grades and test scores. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR So I understand that you\u2019re not interested in any Catholic colleges?  LADY BIRD No way. Sorry, but yes, no way. 31.    GUIDANCE COUNSELOR Then you\u2019ll be applying to UCs and State schools? LADY BIRD Yes, but also those East Coast liberal arts schools. Like Yale, but not Yale because I probably couldn\u2019t get in. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR (laughs) You definitely couldn\u2019t get in. Part of my job is to help you be realistic.  LADY BIRD That seems like everyone\u2019s job. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR Your SAT scores are strangely very good. Lady Bird shrugs.  GUIDANCE COUNSELOR (CONT\u2019D) I\u2019d placed some calls to local alumni of the schools you\u2019re interested in, but unfortunately all the interviews are taken. LADY BIRD So... what does that mean? GUIDANCE COUNSELOR It means that you\u2019ll have to get in on how you look on paper. INT. THEATRE. DAY. The kids rehearse -- following dance moves and singing. EXT. ROSE GARDEN. NIGHT. Lady Bird and Danny lie on a blanket in the park, looking up at the stars.  DANNY Shouldn\u2019t we go home?   LADY BIRD (shakes her head) My Mom is always mad. It doesn\u2019t matter if I get home late, she\u2019d be mad at me anyway. DANNY 32.  Your Mom is hard on you. LADY BIRD (defensively) She loves me a lot. (then) Pick a star for us. DANNY  (pointing) That one, right there right next to the bright one and then the dim one - see it? LADY BIRD That\u2019s our star.  LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) (whispering) You know you can touch my boobs, right?  DANNY I know... it\u2019s just.... I respect you too much for that. LADY BIRD Oh, cool, awesome. I totally get that. Thank you. DANNY You're welcome. 33.    LADY BIRD If you had boobs I wouldn\u2019t touch them either. DANNY I respect you so much because... I love you. LADY BIRD I love you, too. They kiss and look back up at the stars. DANNY Let\u2019s name our star Claude. Lady Bird makes a face. LADY BIRD That\u2019s pretentious, don\u2019t you think?  DANNY It\u2019s French. (then) What should we name it? LADY BIRD BRUCE. They laugh and kiss and yell to the heavens.  DANNY I LOVE YOU!  LADY BIRD I LOVE YOU!  They hug and are the happiest they\u2019ve ever been, looking up at the sky and loving each other. 34.    LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) (whispers) Bruce. EXT. HALLWAYS OF IMMACULATE HEART OF MARY. DAY.  Julie and Lady Bird wander the hallways. Julie shoves a cupcake in her mouth, so does Lady Bird. The wander and chew contemplatively. LADY BIRD (not really to anyone) It\u2019s normal to not touch a penis. JULIE (looks around, notices everyone is gone) I have to go to class. LADY BIRD But I have free period! JULIE I need to pass history! LADY BIRD I think we\u2019re done with the learning portion of high school. JULIE I\u2019m gonna go.  LADY  BIRD NO! I HATE BEING ALONE!  JULIE Bye, love you. Julie takes off. Lady Bird lazily walks the halls.  She sees her empty math classroom and sees that Mr. Bruno isn\u2019t there. She ducks inside. Notices his grade binder on the desk. Snatches it and then runs. She dumps it into one of the big trash cans and hurries away. 35.    INT. THRIFT TOWN. DAY. Marion and Lady Bird are looking through dresses. MARION Did Danny say whether his grandmother has a formal Thanksgiving? LADY BIRD I don\u2019t know, there are a lot of kids, but she lives in the fab forties...  MARION (nodding) Your dad and I went to a dinner party once in that neighborhood, the CEO of ISC, and it was pretty formal. Lady Bird finds something - holds up a black dress. MARION (CONT\u2019D) You\u2019re not going to a funeral. LADY BIRD Well, I don\u2019t know! What says \u201crich people Thanksgiving\u201d? They keep looking.  MARION It\u2019s just such a shame that you\u2019re spending your last Thanksgiving with a family you\u2019ve never met instead of us, but I guess you want it that way. (clocks her walking) Are you tired? LADY BIRD No. A saleswoman, Joyce, calls out: JOYCE SALESWOMAN Hey Marion!  Marion waves to the saleswoman. Her voice is so warm and friendly with other people who are not her daughter: MARION Hey Joyce! How\u2019s the baby!  36.   JOYCE SALESWOMAN He\u2019s crawling! MARION Ooohhh, I want to see a picture at checkout! (back to Lady Bird) If you\u2019re tired we can sit down. LADY BIRD I\u2019m not tired! MARION Oh it\u2019s just that I couldn\u2019t tell because you\u2019re dragging your feet. LADY BIRD (silence) MARION Well, I just couldn\u2019t tell. LADY BIRD Why didn\u2019t you just say \u201cPick up your feet.\u201d MARION I didn\u2019t know if you were tired. LADY BIRD You were being passive aggressive! MARION No. I wasn\u2019t. LADY BIRD You are so INFURIATING. MARION Please stop yelling. LADY BIRD I\u2019m not yelling.  Marion sees something. Holds it up. It\u2019s a beautiful old fashioned looking dress. Marion has found the needle in the haystack.  LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Oh it\u2019s perfect!  MARION Don\u2019t you love it.  37.    INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S HOUSE. LATE AT NIGHT.  Marion, still in her nurses uniform, sits at the sewing machine, tailoring the dress she and Lady Bird found. She finishes, and then hangs it up quietly in Lady Bird\u2019s room. Doesn\u2019t wake her up, simply watches her daughter sleep for a minute. INT. ALGEBRA II CLASS. DAY. Mr. Bruno addresses his class: MR. Bruno So because my gradebook has disappeared, I am going to count on you to reconstruct it. I know you all know your grades better than anybody. I have a general idea, but this is all about the honor code right now, okay?  They are going up one by one to talk through their grade and he can start again.  JULIE A- MR. Bruno I\u2019m pretty sure it was an A. JULIE Um, I\u2019m not but okay... MR. Bruno It was \u2013 trust me, I know talent when I see it.  JULIE You\u2019re welcome. No, thank you.  He does that wink thing at her again. She retreats, red faced. Lady Bird is next: LADY BIRD Hey, I think B. MR. Bruno I thought it was more like B- maybe even C+ territory. LADY BIRD No, because I did really well on the last quiz... 38.    MR. Bruno I seem to remember you doing only slightly better.  LADY BIRD It brought my average up to a B. MR. Bruno Okay, B it is. It\u2019s your honor. INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S HOUSE. DAY.  Marion, Larry, Shelly and Miguel run around making sure the house is perfect for their Thanksgiving. The doorbell rings. MIGUEL LADY BIRD! YOUR LOVER AWAITS! Marion opens the door, lets in Danny. MARION Hello, Danny! The famous Danny! Aren\u2019t you adorable! (she  hugs  him) Larry isn\u2019t he adorable? LARRY He\u2019s adorable. MARION And you\u2019re driving her and everything - Wow! DANNY Thank you for letting Lady Bird come to my Grandmother\u2019s Thanksgiving, Mrs. McPherson. MARION No more politeness, just call me Marion!  DANNY (firmly shaking Larry\u2019s hand) Nice to meet you, Mr. McPherson. LARRY Please, call me Mr. Larry McPherson.39.    MARION (hits him)  Larry! Sit down Danny, can I get you something to drink?    DANNY Oh no, I\u2019m fine.   MIGUEL (waving) Hi, I\u2019m Miguel. The brother. I think Lady Bird wants to make an entrance. She\u2019s mad we don\u2019t have a spiral staircase. SHELLY (quietly) Shelly.   What? DANNY  SHELLY Is my name. They\u2019re quiet for a moment. Danny tries to converse: DANNY It\u2019s funny, on my way here, I went over the train tracks -- MARION You took H street? DANNY Right, and so just Lady Bird always says that she lives on the wrong side of the tracks, but I always thought that it was, like, a metaphor.   Ah. MARION  DANNY But there are actual train tracks. Marion\u2019s face contorts. This is painful.  Just then, Lady Bird enters, looking beautiful in her vintage dress. She holds a duffel bag. MARION (now upset with her) What in the hell is in that duffel bag? 40.    LADY BIRD Don\u2019t worry about it, Jeez! DANNY My grandmother will love that dress. INT. DANNY\u2019S GRANDMOTHER\u2019S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON.  Thanksgiving. It is at the Dream House. From the beginning. The blue one with the white trim and the American Flag. Lady Bird cannot believe it.  LADY BIRD Wait, this is your grandma\u2019s house? Oh my god.   She meets his Grandmother, almost kisses her hand like she\u2019s a queen but pulls back just in time: LADY BIRD Your house is my favorite in all of East Sacramento.    Lady Bird and Danny walk through the house. She spots very prominent Ronald Regan poster: LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Is this... a joke? DANNY No.  Lady Bird meets people, so many people, and in a lull, folds a napkin in a cool way - it looks like a four-pointed flower. Danny\u2019s Grandmother notices, and IS TOTALLY INTO IT. Soon, Lady Bird is folding all the napkins at the tables this way, teaches her how to do it, too. It is clear how much Danny\u2019s Grandmother enjoys Lady Bird. INT. DANNY\u2019S CAR. NIGHT  Lady Bird and Danny are singing along with songs from the show. Pick up Julie from her apartment complex. Pick up Greg from his house. Now they\u2019re all singing.  In the car, they change out of their Thanksgiving \u201cfinery\u201d and put on what they consider to be \u201cpeople who listen to music in coffee shop\u201d outfits. That was what the duffel was for, the costume change. There are scarves and a beret. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. NIGHT.  In their new outfits, Greg and Danny and Julie and Lady Bird smoke a out of a bowl, which another one of them lights. 41.  LADY BIRD How do you know when it\u2019s working? 42.    DANNY You\u2019ll know. LADY BIRD It\u2019s not working. GREG It\u2019s not? My sister said this was premium.  JULIE I\u2019m working. DANNY I\u2019m working too. LADY BIRD Nope. They are quiet for a second. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) I can\u2019t feel my arms. GREG You\u2019re working. They laugh really hard. Danny makes out with Lady Bird.  INT. NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. NIGHT.  They hazily take stock of everything. There are some ironic turkeys pinned up on the stage. The \u201ccool kids\u201d are there. They don\u2019t say hi but they don\u2019t shun them. Jenna Walton is there with her boyfriend, Jonah Ruiz. He\u2019s singing pretty terrible songs about her with his band, the pretentiously named L\u2019enfance Nue. LADY BIRD (whispered to Julie) If Danny and I get married and then his Grandma died, I\u2019d inherit the Dream House. JULIE Wouldn\u2019t his parent\u2019s get it? LADY BIRD (realizing) Oh yeah, we\u2019d have to kill them. And kill his older brothers, too. 43.    Kyle Scheible, a long-haired beautiful bassist, is really into it. Lady Bird spends an extra-long time looking at this Kyle Scheible. She feels DEEPLY ATTRACTED to him. She looks at Danny, she loves him, yes, but there is something else going on with Kyle Scheible. She\u2019s not sure, maybe it\u2019s the pot. Maybe not. REMEMBER KYLE, Lady Bird will.  Meanwhile, Mr. Bruno is there - weird. He looks at Julie, who was looking at him. She turns quickly away. JULIE (to no one) Where is Mr. Bruno\u2019s wife...? INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S HOUSE. NIGHT.  Lady Bird and Danny stand by the microwave, making \u201cSmart Ones\u201d frozen dinners. Six of them. Greg and Julie also eat, everyone with their own spoon taking bites out of the different platters.  Then Marion walks in - they are still giggling, she awkwardly announces herself:  MARION How\u2019s it going?  No one can say anything, it\u2019s almost like they\u2019re frozen. Finally Lady Bird is able to squeak out: LADY BIRD Mom, we really can\u2019t talk right now. They all dissolve into giggles again. MARION Well, Happy Thanksgiving. We missed you, Lady Bird. Marion leaves. She\u2019s hurt and angry but mostly hurt. EXT. LADY BIRD\u2019S FRONT YARD. NIGHT The kids all pile back into Danny\u2019s car. Lady Bird waves goodbye, all of them laughing. Then they are gone. Lady Bird shivers a little, now alone. Startles when she sees Shelly smoking:  LADY BIRD  (curious) Why does that cigarette look so weird? Like not like cigarette? 44.    Shelly offers her a drag. Lady Bird drags and coughs. SHELLY It\u2019s a clove. Lick your lips. That\u2019s why they\u2019re sweet. (then) Your Mom was really sad you weren\u2019t here tonight for Thanksgiving. LADY BIRD Well, she hates me. SHELLY She has a big heart, your Mom. She took me in after my parents freaked out about, whatever, pre-marital sex. I admire her. Lady Bird doesn\u2019t fight Shelly. INT. XAVIER. GIRLS DRESSING ROOM. EARLY EVENING. ` Buzzing in the girls dressing room. It\u2019s opening night!  They are putting up pictures and do-dads. They are exchanging \u201copening night\u201d gifts. The girls are applying too much makeup. There is music playing and lots of screaming. INT. XAVIER. BOYS DRESSING ROOM. EARLY EVENING. The boys also get ready. They are putting on powder and combing their hair. It\u2019s less loud, but also kinetic.  INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. EARLY EVENING.  All the boys and girls are gathered in a circle. Father Leviatch and Miss Patty are leading the prayer.  FATHER LEVIATCH SAINT IGNATIUS OF LOYOLA... EVERYONE (shouts) PRAY FOR US! DANNY LIVE JESUS IN OUR HEARTS... 45.    EVERYONE FOREVER!  They break and cheer. It\u2019s time for the show. INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT. The show is about to begin. The audience sits in the dark. The students in the wings. The paltry orchestra strikes up the first chord.  MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG is actually a pretty upsetting and adult show. Julie sings a song about divorce. The other \u201cfabulous\u201d girl, Diana, plays a character who has an affair. There\u2019s lots of pretend drinking of alcohol. They dance and sing their hearts out  Everyone cheers at the end, but more about the fact of the show as opposed to the show itself.  The audience includes the whole of Lady Bird\u2019s family, Julie\u2019s Mom and Uncle Matt, Danny\u2019s whole Irish-Catholic clan. Everyone is proud. INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT.  Mingling after the show. Some of the administrators look scandalized.  Julie sees Mr. Bruno and approaches him, feeling beautiful and confident:  MR. BRUNO There she is! Jules, wow! You were so good. I couldn\u2019t believe that. JULIE Thank you... MR. BRUNO Jules, I\u2019d like you to meet my wife, Becky. Becky this is Jules, one of my brightest students. BECKY Nice to meet you. JULIE (devastated) Nice to meet you, too. MR. BRUNO How we doing? 46.    BECKY Yeah, I\u2019m a little tired. MR. BRUNO Okay, I gotta get her home, we\u2019ve got the little one, but great work Jules.  JULIE (as they leave) Congratulations.  Julie is humiliated, and doesn\u2019t quite know why. She sits down next to Father Leviatch, who also looks traumatized. He watches people pass him by: FATHER LEVIATCH They didn\u2019t understand it INT. DINER. NIGHT.  The entire cast and crew is there, enjoying their opening night, eating a lot of chicken fingers and french fries. They are being silly and playing a Broadway trivia game. Lady Bird and Danny make towers with the sugar packets. Julie and Greg hang out together: they\u2019re both the \u201cextra\u201d friends. Everyone is giddy and happy. INT. DINER GIRLS BATHROOM. NIGHT. Julie and Lady Bird wait for the stalls to open up. LADY BIRD HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU ALL WILL BE I DRANK SO MUCH SODA! STALL WOMAN (O.S.) Fuck you. CHORUS MEMBER (O.S.) I just got my period! LADY BIRD Goddamn it! Lady Bird leaves.  JULIE Where are you going? 47.    LADY BIRD There\u2019s never a line in the men\u2019s room! INT. MEN\u2019S ROOM. NIGHT.  Lady Bird opens the door and opens a stall and there, in front of her: Danny and Greg making out hard. Julie comes tumbling in from behind. INT. JULIE\u2019S ROOM. JULIE\u2019S HOUSE. NIGHT.  They both cry. They listen to \u201cCrash Into Me\u201d by Dave Matthews and sob. The song ends and Lady Bird starts it over. INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT. They perform the next night. No fun. It\u2019s no fun because their boyfriends are gay. INT. DOCTOR\u2019S OFFICE. DAY. Lady Bird gets her cast off with a saw. Marion watches. The doctor throws the cast in the trash. She is mournful. INT. ST. FRANCIS. DAY. Finals. Lady Bird casually cheats off the girl sitting next to her. INT. LIVING ROOM. CHRISTMAS DAY. Everyone gets socks and underwear for Christmas. Even Shelly. MARION They\u2019re really nice socks. MARION They\u2019re expensive, actually. They wick moisture away from your feet. SHELLY Yeah my feet always have moisture. LADY BIRD Mom, I love them. 48.    MARION (embarrassed) I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s Small Christmas. We wanted to, well, it\u2019s just a little small this year. Larry opens his gift. (laughing) It\u2019s just what I needed, honey.  He holds up a throw pillow that says \u201cGolfers Don\u2019t Diet They Just Exist On Greens.\u201d He laughs. MARION (laughing, too) It makes me laugh. INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S ROOM. NIGHT. A gentle knock on the door. LADY BIRD (O.S.) Dad? Come in. LARRY (entering) How did you know it was me? LADY BIRD Mom doesn\u2019t knock. LARRY (laughs) No, she doesn\u2019t. He gives her an envelope. Quietly says: LARRY (CONT\u2019D) Here they are, your completed financial aid applications. Merry Christmas. Lady Bird throws her arms around Larry. LADY BIRD Thank you! Thank you! LARRY Do you need money for the applications? Because I can help with that, too, I just need to -- 49.    LADY BIRD -- no, no, I\u2019ve got that, summer jobs covered it. INT. FAMILY/COMPUTER/MIGUEL\u2019S ROOM. COMPUTER. DAY.  Lady Bird frantically fills out her applications: addresses things, puts materials in envelopes. MIGUEL This is why we have computer shut- off time - this is our room. He indicates Shelly, looking forlorn by the pullout sofa-bed. LADY BIRD Okay, okay, just can you drive me to the post office on J? It should still be open.  EXT. POST OFFICE. NIGHT.  They are just closing up for the night. Lady Bird runs up and posts them at the last minute. EXT. LADY BIRD\u2019S HOUSE. PORCH. MIDNIGHT.  Lady Bird and her family are out celebrating New Years. Noise makers and sparklers. Happy 2003! Everyone wears the glasses with the zeros for the eyes. INT. NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. AFTERNOON. This is where she got high the first time and the band played - now Lady Bird learns the cash-register, espresso machine, and then sees Kyle Scheible, that amazing looking bassist, sitting at a table outside, plowing through \u201cThe People\u2019s History of the United States.\u201d Later, he steps outside to smoke, she notices and follows: LADY BIRD Hey! I like your band with Jonah Ruiz, L'enfance Nue? (she pronounces it Lenfance New) KYLE (correcting her pronunciation) L\u2019enfance Nue. LADY BIRD I saw your Thanksgiving show. My name\u2019s Lady Bird.  50.    They shake hands. There is something instantly sexual between them. Lady Bird has never felt this thing before. She gets all R&B songs ever written in one moment. KYLE It\u2019s weird you shake hands.  LADY BIRD Yeah.(lying) Yeah, I\u2019m friends with Jenna and she\u2019s always talking about how great your band is so I wanted to check it out. KYLE Jenna\u2019s hella tight. Well maybe I\u2019ll see you at the Deuce or something.  LADY BIRD Sure, see you at the Deuce. COOL TWENTY SOMETHING (yelling out to Lady Bird) I\u2019m not paying you to flirt! LADY BIRD (embarrassed) I wasn\u2019t flirting. KYLE I wish you had been. And then he\u2019s gone. Lady Bird\u2019s loins are on fire. INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S ROOM. NIGHT. She writes Kyle\u2019s name next to where she\u2019d written Danny\u2019s name. Touches her hand where he\u2019d touched it. Then touches her mouth. She wants, she wants. 50.    SECOND SEMESTER INT. CHURCH. DAY.  Joint liturgy at another beginning of the semester. Lady Bird sits next to Julie and sings in the choir and scans for Kyle.  From under her choir robe, Lady Bird pulls out \u201cThe People\u2019s History of the United States\u201d and reads it while the priest delivers the homily.  Danny tries to make eye contact with Lady Bird but she coldly looks away. Her eyes rest on Jenna - she wants Kyle as her boyfriend and Jenna as her friend. She wants to be part of this thing, this popular-straight-kid thing she\u2019s always been outside of. Lady Bird takes her blessing, arms crossed. INT. HOMEROOM. DAY. JENNA The first time we did it was at his lake house last summer. It was so funny... Julie hands Lady Bird a sack lunch: JULIE From Uncle Matt. I think he and my Mom are fighting, so enjoy these lunches while you can. LADY BIRD Oh, no thanks, I\u2019m trying to lose weight. JULIE Really?  But Lady Bird isn\u2019t paying attention. She\u2019s angling towards Jenna Walton, the tan, who holds court: JENNA Yeah, sex is not a big deal, it\u2019s just my mom called during it! Everyone laughs. 51.    JENNA (CONT\u2019D) It was on my cell phone, she got it for emergencies. LADY BIRD Did you pick up? JENNA Yeah, I was like, um, Mom, I can't really talk right now. Everyone else laughs again. Julie now tries to join in: JULIE (to Jenna) What was the emergency? JENNA What? Oh, my great aunt died. JULIE What was the emergency? JENNA Oh, my great aunt died. LADY BIRD I'm so sorry. JENNA She kind of  did it to herself. Yeah. I don\u2019t know why do that if you\u2019re already so old.  Sister Sarah-Joan approaches: SISTER SARAH-JOAN Ladies - skirts?  Jenna's skirt doesn\u2019t make the grade, it\u2019s been hemmed.  SISTER SARAH-JOAN (CONT\u2019D) I\u2019m going to write you a citation, Miss Walton. 52.    SISTER SARAH-JOAN No more short skirts! She continues on, inspecting other skirts. JENNA Sarah-Joan is all up in my jock. LADY BIRD She\u2019s a cunt. JULIE Birdy you like her. LADY BIRD Yeah, but, she\u2019s a cunt. (to Jenna) I have an idea of how to get Sarah- Joan back... JENNA How? LADY BIRD You\u2019ll see. This afternoon? JULIE No, we have auditions this afternoon. LADY BIRD I don\u2019t think I want to do the play. (to Jenna) Meet me in the teacher\u2019s parking lot at 3. I\u2019ll have the materials. JENNA Wait what was your name? LADY BIRD Lady Bird. JENNA Weird.  SISTER SARAH-JOAN We have a decision to make: prom themes! The top options are -- Cities of the World, Eternal Flame, and Movies! INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. DAY.  Everyone who has come to audition is greeted by the new director: Father Walther, also the JV football coach. GIRL #1 53.  Where\u2019s Father Leviatch? FATHER WALTHER Alright let\u2019s have everyone take a knee. Confusion. Miss Patty won\u2019t make eye contact with them   MISS PATTY Cozy sit. FATHER WALTHER So I know that you all miss Father Leviatch, all of the brothers do too, but I am going to give this my very best shot, okay? Usually I\u2019m the J.V. football coach, but from what I can tell a \u201cplay\u201d is a \u201cplay.\u201d No real response. Danny sits with Julie, whispers: DANNY Where\u2019s Lady Bird? JULIE (quietly angry) With her new best friend. She thinks she\u2019s too cool for theatre. Father Walther wheels out a blackboard and picks up chalk. FATHER WALTHER Now if you can pull out your scripts. I\u2019ve assigned a number to each of your roles. I\u2019m going to put the blocking on this board, and if you guys can transcribe into your plays, that\u2019d be great. JULIE (calling out) Who is playing what part? FATHER WALTHER I had Miss Patty assign parts because she already knows you all. Miss Patty nods.  FATHER WALTHER (CONT\u2019D) Call \u2018em out Miss Patty! Miss Patty starts: 54.    MISS PATTY (slightly drunk on power) Uh, Prospero, Danny.  Julie is Miranda - she\u2019s happy, maybe she\u2019s good at this? EXT. TEACHER PARKING LOT. AFTERNOON. Jenna and Lady Bird are decorating the nun mini-van with tin cans and streamers and attach a sign to the back that reads: JUST MARRIED TO JESUS. As they\u2019re completing their mission: JENNA Wait, where do you live? LADY BIRD Oh, um, the 40s. JENNA That\u2019s where our starter house was! Which street? LADY BIRD (lying, again) Um, 44th it\u2019s, um, it\u2019s the three story blue house with the white shutters and the American flag in the front.  She describes the house that she and Julie lusted after last fall, Danny\u2019s Grandmother\u2019s house. JENNA I know that one! Wanna go over there now and eat? I live in Granite Bay otherwise I\u2019d say lets go there.  LADY BIRD Um, actually, I was thinking - maybe we should go to the Deuce? (trying to be casual) I was talking to Kyle about it and he was like \u201cwhatever it\u2019s lame but maybe I\u2019ll see you there.\u201d JENNA How do you know Kyle? 55.    LADY BIRD My Mom made me get a job at New Helvetia to learn \u201cresponsibility\u201d Anyway we hang out there. JENNA Yeah, Kyle\u2019s awesome. let\u2019s Deuce it up. INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. DAY.  Father Walther is writing all the blocking on the blackboard like the football coach he is. All the students are frantically taking down the notes in their scripts. EXT. SIERRA II. \u201cTHE DEUCE.\u201d PARKING LOT. DAY.  Jenna joins Jonah & co in the parking lot, drinking and smoking. Kyle is there, sitting on top of a car reading another big book, a theoretical math book. For fun. LADY BIRD This is the Deuce? It\u2019s a parking lot? We were in one parking lot and we went to another parking lot. JENNA (calling out) KYLE! Lady Bird and I just decorated the nun-mobile like \u201cjust married to Jesus! KYLE That\u2019s hella tight.  He nods, appreciating this. Jonah starts to make out with Jenna. Lady Bird tries not to watch. KYLE (CONT\u2019D) What you did was very baller, very anarchist.  LADY BIRD Yeah, fuck \u2018em. KYLE Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not gonna snitch on you. LADY BIRD (fake threatening) I hope not, because I\u2019d fucking kill your family. 56.    What?  KYLE  LADY BIRD Sorry that was an exaggeration. KYLE It\u2019s okay. My Dad has cancer. So I guess God is doing that for us. LADY BIRD Oh... I\u2019m sorry. They\u2019re quiet for a second, he\u2019s said something heavy. KYLE You work at New Helvetia, right? LADY BIRD Right. KYLE Can I get your number? We were looking to set up some more gigs down there... LADY BIRD Definitely.  He holds out his hand and a pen. Lady Bird takes his hand and the pen. When she touches him, it\u2019s the same as before: SEX. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) It\u2019s my parents\u2019 number. KYLE You don\u2019t have a cell phone? LADY BIRD Nah. KYLE Good girl. The government didn\u2019t have to put tracking devices on us, we bought them and put them on ourselves.  LADY BIRD I don\u2019t own a tracking device... KYLE No the cell phones. See? 57.    Wow.  LADY BIRD  KYLE Yeah. I know. I mean you\u2019ll have one eventually. Everyone\u2019s gonna have one. And then it\u2019ll be a matter of time. LADY BIRD Before what? KYLE Before they put them in our brains.  Lady Bird laughs and then stops herself. He is dead fucking serious. She wants to touch him again but can\u2019t invent a reason why. INT. NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. AFTERNOON.  Lady Bird works. Zones out from time to time, thinking about Kyle. Danny comes in and then lurks. She spots him, goes to throw out the trash, annoyed that he\u2019s there. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. AFTERNOON. Lady Bird walks out, Danny follows her. She wheels around: LADY BIRD What do you want from me? He doesn\u2019t say anything. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) YES?! DANNY My Grandma wanted me to tell you she missed you at Christmas. LADY BIRD Yeah, well, I couldn\u2019t have gone anyway... my Mom was pissed about Thanksgiving. DANNY (nodding) Your mom is crazy. I\u2019m scared of her. 58.    LADY BIRD (suddenly defensive) She\u2019s not crazy, she\u2019s just, she has a big heart. She\u2019s very warm. DANNY I don\u2019t find your mother warm. LADY BIRD You don\u2019t? DANNY Well no yeah she\u2019s warm but she\u2019s also kind of scary. LADY BIRD You can\u2019t be scary and warm. DANNY (logically debating) I think you can, your Mom is.  LADY BIRD YOU\u2019RE YOU\u2019RE GAY! That shuts him up. They\u2019re quiet. DANNY (suddenly, desperate) Fuck me. Can you not tell anyone, please? I\u2019m so sorry about everything. I\u2019m so ashamed of all of it. It\u2019s going to be bad and I just need a little bit of time to figure out how I\u2019m going to tell my mom and dad. He almost starts crying. LADY BIRD (pats him awkwardly) Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell. DANNY (leaning into her,sobbing)  Thank you.    59.     He\u2019s telling the truth and she is genuinely touched. They embrace again. They are friends, real friends now. INT. PSYCH HOSPITAL. CHECK-IN. DAY.  Marion helps a patient fill out a questionnaire. It is Father Leviatch, who looks how he feels - crushed by bottomless despair. This is his struggle. MARION ...and do you have a support system?  FATHER LEVIATCH What do you mean? MARION (gently) Who do you turn to when you feel this way?  FATHER LEVIATCH No one, I guess. I\u2019m sorry. MARION No, no, don\u2019t be sorry. There\u2019s no wrong answer. She looks at him with true empathy. He realizes something. FATHER LEVIATCH Please don\u2019t tell your daughter. MARION No of course not. Of course not. 60.    INT. CHURCH. DAY.  All of Xavier and Immaculate Heart of Mary are assembled for Ash Wednesday Mass.  Everyone gets ash on their forehead. Julie looks on enviously as Lady Bird jokes around with Jenna and flirts with Kyle from across the aisle.  The priest repeats the incantation every time he applies ashes to the foreheads.  PRIEST Remember that you are dust and to dust you shall return... Remember that you are dust and to dust you shall return.... INT. FAMILY/COMPUTER/MIGUEL\u2019S ROOM. DAY.  Lady Bird sits at the computer with a list of instructions in front of her - Marion, Larry, Shelly and Miguel stand behind her.  LADY BIRD It\u2019s a new system - you just enter your social security number and...  She is presses ENTER and is lead you to a website that lists all the schools in the UC system she applied to with a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno\u201d beside them. They all say no except for... LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) DAVIS?! MARION (relieved) Davis is good. Maybe you should have looked at it. LADY BIRD It\u2019s only half an hour away! Less if you\u2019re driving fast! LARRY I went to graduate school there. SHELLY Lots of smart people go to Davis. LADY BIRD I thought Berkeley had to accept me. You and Miguel went there. I\u2019m a legacy. 61.    LARRY Eh, not if we don\u2019t give money. MIGUEL And you get bad grades. LADY BIRD Oh what do you know about it? MIGUEL Meaning? Nothing. LADY BIRD MIGUEL (turning red)  What are you implying?  MIGUEL YOU FUCKING RACIST. LADY BIRD I didn\u2019t say anything. MIGUEL I DIDN\u2019T PUT DOWN MY RACE! LADY BIRD I\u2019m sure they had no idea, MIGUEL! MIGUEL You are actually fucking evil. What is wrong with you?    MARION GO - GO TO YOUR ROOM! LADY BIRD I\u2019m not FIVE! MARION I did not raise you like this, I didn\u2019t -- LADY BIRD I don\u2019t have to go ANYWHERE! I\u2019m not going to a fucking university that\u2019s famous for it\u2019s fucking AGRICULTURAL SCHOOL. She runs out, furious. She\u2019d kick the computer if she could.  LADY BIRD (O.S.) (CONT\u2019D) AND MIGUEL AND SHELLY YOU\u2019LL NEVER 62.  GET JOBS WITH ALL THAT SHIT IN YOUR FACE!  Miguel self-consciously puts his hand to his nose-ring, rotating it. Shelly mentally tallies all her piercings. 63.    INT. JENNA'S HOUSE. NIGHT.  A fancy McMansion, giant but not utterly tasteless. A low-key house party. Lady Bird wanders through the palatial house, looking for Jenna. Runs up to her: LADY BIRD Hey!  JENNA (hugging her) Hi! Help yourself to anything in the fridge. My parent\u2019s are upstairs but they don\u2019t care if you drink.  She nods and moves on. What she\u2019s looking for is Kyle of course. She spots Kyle outside, reading a book and smoking. EXT. JENNA'S HOUSE. BY THE POOL. NIGHT.  Lady Bird casually slinks outside and lights up a clove, like she does it all the time. Kyle notices like he was meant to. KYLE I hate that shit. LADY BIRD But you smoke. KYLE Hand rolled cigarettes - never industrially produced and never cloves. LADY BIRD What\u2019s wrong with cloves? KYLE You can\u2019t inhale cloves. What\u2019s the point? LADY BIRD Oh... KYLE You\u2019re not supposed to. LADY BIRD Cloves were what I first smoked, when I was young, so you know, force of habit. KYLE Huh. Well it has fiber glass. 64.    Really?  LADY BIRD  KYLE Rolling your own is best. Also I\u2019m trying to, as much as is possible, not participate in our economy. I don\u2019t like money. I am trying to live by bartering alone. LADY BIRD But doesn\u2019t Catholic school cost money?  KYLE Yeah the diocese were not super into it. (then) It mattered to my Dad that I go to Xavier, so just trying to make him happy.  She sits down next to him. He touches her face. She breathes out hard. He kisses her and she kisses back.  CUT TO:  Another part of the house: Kyle and Lady Bird are making out full on. She wants it, but not so fast: LADY BIRD I don\u2019t want to have sex yet. I haven\u2019t had sex yet. With another person. KYLE No, me neither. LADY BIRD Really? Yeah. Cool.  KYLE LADY BIRD They start making out again. They fall into a door and it reveals THE FAMOUS TANNING BED. Lady Bird laughs. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Oh my god! It\u2019s the tanning bed! Julie will love this! 65.    KYLE Who\u2019s Julie? INT. BATHROOM. DAY.  Lady Bird sits on the edge of the tub and looks at a picture of Kyle from the \u201cXavier\u201d insert in the Immaculate Heart of Mary Yearbook.  CUT TO:  Just Lady Bird\u2019s feet on either side of the tub-tile, the water streaming down. It\u2019s obvious what she\u2019s doing. CUT TO:  She\u2019s out. She has towels wrapped around her body and head. She rummages around the medicine cabinet. She sees a pill bottle and looks at it. It\u2019s antidepressants for her Dad. She puts it back, carefully. MARION (O.S.) Lady Bird! You can\u2019t lock yourself in there! We have one bathroom! LADY BIRD (opening the door) Sorry, sorry, sorry! LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) It\u2019s just this is the only place I can get any privacy. Marion clocks the towels around Lady Bird\u2019s head and body: MARION Do you really need to use two towels?  LADY BIRD No, I guess no. MARION If you need two towels you just have to say so because this affects my whole day, I have to do laundry before work and I need to know if there are more towels I need to wash.  LADY BIRD I just need one, sorry. 66.    MARION OK, well let me get to the mirror, I gotta get going. Lady Bird backs up, watches Marion put on makeup. LADY BIRD When do you think is a normal time to have sex? MARION (drops her mascara) You\u2019re having sex? LADY BIRD No! MARION Uh, college is good, I think college. Use protection. Like we talked about.  LADY BIRD Ok.  They regard each other.  LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Is Dad depressed? MARION (looking from the mirror) Why do you ask that? LADY BIRD The pills... they have Dad\u2019s name on them. Marion\u2019s not sure she should talk about it, but then does: MARION Dad\u2019s been struggling with depression for years.  LADY BIRD I didn\u2019t know that. 67.    MARION Money is not life\u2019s report card. LADY BIRD He\u2019s depressed about money? MARION Being successful doesn\u2019t mean anything in and of itself. It just means that you\u2019re successful. LADY BIRD (confused) Yeah, but then you\u2019re successful. MARION But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re happy. LADY BIRD But he\u2019s not happy. EXT. JENNA\u2019S HOUSE. POOL. DAY.  Lady Bird and Jenna messing around in her big pool, splashing each other, being teenage ladies-of-leisure. Lady Bird is feeling the weight of her life, the heft of it. LADY BIRD I have to get out of Sacramento. JENNA Why? LADY BIRD Because it\u2019s soul-killing. It\u2019s the mid-west of California. JENNA Isn\u2019t there a thing, like: \u201cthink globally, act locally.\u201d LADY BIRD I feel that the person who said that didn\u2019t live in Sacramento. JENNA I love it here. I want to send my daughters to Immaculate Heart. I want to be, you know, be a mom.  68.    LADY BIRD At least go to San Francisco. JENNA I don't like hills.  Jenna disappears under the water. Lady Bird considers that perhaps Jenna is not such a good fit for her as a friend, even if she is popular and cool. They aren\u2019t the same. INT. ALGEBRA II CLASS. DAY.  Julie\u2019s desk is empty beside Lady Bird. She misses her real friend. INT. ST. FRANCIS HALLWAYS. DAY.  Lady Bird sees Julie walking in the hallway with Darlene, the weird girl from choir. She calls out: LADY BIRD Julie! Julie! Julie, hey! DARLENE (aggressive) What do you want from Julie? LADY BIRD Darlene can you excuse us? JULIE Darlene, stay. So Darlene stays, her creepy cow eyes taking in the scene. LADY BIRD Why aren\u2019t you in Algebra II? JULIE I switched sections. LADY BIRD Why? 69.    JULIE Aren\u2019t Jenna and Kyle enough? LADY BIRD I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re jealous. JULIE HA! Jenna is a moron, you know. LADY BIRD She\u2019s not. She\u2019s in AP Calculus. JULIE She\u2019s a moron in a deeper sense. LADY BIRD You don\u2019t even know her.  JULIE -- Miss Patty assigned you a role, by the way. You just never showed up to claim it. LADY BIRD What role? JULIE \u201cThe Tempest.\u201d LADY BIRD There is no role of \u201cThe Tempest.\u201d JULIE It\u2019s the titular role! LADY BIRD No, it\u2019s a made up thing so we all can participate. JULIE Can\u2019t do anything unless you\u2019re the center of attention, can you? LADY BIRD Yeah, well, you know your mom's tits? They're FAKE. TOTALLY FAKE. JULIE She made a bad decision at 19! LADY BIRD Two bad decisions. 70.    Julie leaves with Darlene. Lady Bird is furious and righteous. INT. IMMACULATE HEART OF MARY GYM. DAY.  Everyone sits on the bleachers for a \u201cspecial assembly.\u201d Jenna and Lady Bird sit together. Lady Bird loves being seen with her at this public event.  A woman is speaking - she is heavy-set with a \u201cwedge\u201d haircut. She holds up models of fetuses. 70.   CASEY And at fifteen, this girl was pregnant. She decided that she was going to get an abortion. It made sense. It was the right thing to do.  LADY BIRD (whispering) Let me guess she didn\u2019t get it. CASEY And she was sitting there waiting for the doctor to come in and something deep inside her said NO. LADY BIRD Bingo. CASEY Anyone want to guess who this woman is? Hands shoot up.  CASEY (CONT\u2019D) The young lady right here. YOUNG LADY You? 71.    CASEY No, it was not me. ANOTHER YOUNG LADY Um, your friend? CASEY No, the girl in the story was... my mother. Gasps from the audience. CASEY (CONT\u2019D) I am that baby that she decided not to abort.   Cut to: Laminated graphics about abortion are being passed around.  CASEY (CONT\u2019D) That could have been me, that could have been my fate. LADY BIRD (to Jenna) Just because something looks ugly doesn\u2019t mean that it is morally wrong. Unfortunately this comment was loud enough for Casey to hear. CASEY What did you say, ma\u2019am? LADY BIRD Nothing. CASEY Please share.  Lady Bird looks at Jenna and decides that she\u2019s really going to impress her:  LADY BIRD (loud) I said \u201cJust because something looks ugly doesn\u2019t mean that it is morally wrong.\u201d The girls are shocked and embarrassed, but laughing too. 72.    CASEY You think dead children aren\u2019t morally wrong? LADY BIRD No... She\u2019s going all in: LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) I\u2019m just saying that if you took up close pictures of my vagina while I was on my period it would be disturbing but it doesn\u2019t make it wrong.  GASPS! Sister Sarah-Joan clocks Lady Bird\u2019s escalating mania. She briefly makes eye-contact with her. Lady-Bird is ashamed, but uses her shame to plow ahead rather than turn back. CASEY (horrified) Excuse me? What did you say? LADY BIRD Listen, if your mother had had the abortion we wouldn't have to sit through this stupid assembly?  MARION (O.S.) Suspended?! HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?! INT. FAMILY/COMPUTER/MIGUEL\u2019S ROOM. NIGHT. Marion is furious. Larry pretends to work on the computer.   MARION EVERYTHING we do is for you. EVERYTHING. You think I like driving that car around. Do you? You think I like working double shifts at the psych hospital? You needed to go to the Catholic school because your brother saw someone knifed in front of him at the public school, is that what you want? MARION (turns on Larry)     LADY-BIRD  No. No. No. No....  LARRY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON THE COMPUTER?!   Nothing. 73.  LARRY  MARION (back to Lady Bird) You think Dad and I don\u2019t know how ashamed that you are of us? Your dad knows, your dad knows why you ask us to drop you a block away from school every day - LADY BIRD - Dad I didn\u2019t mean to - MARION - You made him feel horrible HORRIBLE do you know that? LADY BIRD (crying) I\u2019m sorry.  Larry chimes in. 74.    LARRY Marion you didn\u2019t have to bring that up - MARION - No, Larry, you can\u2019t just be the nice guy, she has to know, she has to know how you feel otherwise she\u2019s just gonna think that she can say anything at all and nobody ever gets hurt.\u201dWrong side of the tracks\u201d. LADY BIRD I didn\u2019t mean it that way, it was a joke --  MARION Yeah, it\u2019s just a joke: \u201cMom and Dad, they don\u2019t care.\u201d We didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be in this house for twenty-five years, we thought we\u2019d move somewhere better, Whatever we give you, it\u2019s never enough. LADY BIRD It is enough.  MARION Do you have any idea how much it cost to raise you? How much you\u2019re THROWING away every day?  Lady Bird, tired of being berated, furiously gets a pen and a piece of paper, poised to write, cuts Marion off: LADY BIRD Give me a number. MARION What? LADY BIRD GIVE ME A NUMBER! MARION I don\u2019t understand. LADY BIRD You give me a number for how much it cost to raise me, and I\u2019m going to get older and make a lot of money and write you a check for what I owe you so that I NEVER HAVE TO SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN. 75.    MARION I highly doubt that you will be able to get a job good enough to do that.  Lady Bird screams and raises her hand at her mother. Brings it down without striking. Leaves the room without a sound. INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S HOUSE. EARLY AFTERNOON.  Lady Bird lounging - watching television. Life during Suspension. All these reports about the lead up to the Iraq war. It\u2019s simultaneously terrifying and boring. The phone rings and she JUMPS at it. LADY BIRD (into the phone) Hello?  JENNA (O.S.) Hi, it\u2019s me! Jenna. LADY BIRD (looking at the time) Are you calling me from school? JENNA (O.S.) No, we got out early because all the Irish girls got totally sloshed by noon... LADY BIRD Oh, right, happy Saint Patrick\u2019s Day!  JENNA (O.S.) I guess they\u2019d been stock-piling mini liquor bottles in the tampon machines. Now they\u2019re all throwing up. Everyone else got out early. So GUESS where I am?! LADY BIRD I don\u2019t know, where? Reveal that Jenna is: EXT. DREAM HOUSE. EARLY AFTERNOON.  It is the house. Danny\u2019s Grandmother\u2019s house. The blue one with the white shutters and the American Flag. The one Lady Bird said she lived in. Jenna is standing there in her uniform. 76.    JENNA DING DONG I\u2019M OUTSIDE! She rings the doorbell. LADY BIRD (O.S.) Oh, shit, no, I\u2019m... wait.  LADY BIRD (O.S.) LEAVE! JUST UM, LEAVE!   INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S KITCHEN. EARLY AFTERNOON.              CUT TO:  Lady Bird and Jenna in her kitchen. Her real kitchen. JENNA (looking around) So this is your house? LADY BIRD Yeah. JENNA The woman who lived in the other house was totally freaked out. LADY BIRD That\u2019s my friend\u2019s grandma. That\u2019s her house.  JENNA Why did you say it was your house? Reaching for the truth that explains it: LADY BIRD I wished I lived in that house.  JENNA I don\u2019t even sort of understand why somebody would lie about that. 77.    LADY BIRD I didn\u2019t lie. JENNA You lied, you\u2019re a liar. JENNA I hate dishonesty. LADY BIRD I\u2019m sorry. JENNA Apology accepted, I guess. LADY BIRD (concerned) Are we still friends? JENNA I mean, if you\u2019re still Kyle\u2019s girlfriend, then yeah, I guess I\u2019ll see you around. Lady Bird looks worried - is she still Kyle\u2019s girlfriend? INT. KYLE\u2019S ROOM. KYLE\u2019S HOUSE. DAY. They watch the news, not touching but oh man she wants to touch.  CUT TO:  Kyle and Lady Bird are making out pretty heavily. Lady Bird is on top.

Gets it on somehow. LADY BIRD You\u2019re so dextrous with that... Oh!  They\u2019re sort of having sex now. She\u2019s still on top. It goes on for a little bit. Then he stops moving. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) (whispering) Are you...? Done? KYLE Yeah. Yes. LADY BIRD Sorry, I was confused. She looks at him. His face is all splotchy. KYLE You have some kind of - blood! LADY BIRD (hands to her face) Oh, shit, I get nose bleeds.  I\u2019m sorry. CUT TO:  Kyle reads. Lady Bird holds a Kleenex to her nose, and looks at a bulletin board with the class picture from first grade - little Kyle wears a tie-dye shirt. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Remember when \u201ctie-dye\u201d was an activity? 79.    KYLE (glancing up) I didn\u2019t make that shirt, my parents bought it for me at Sea Ranch, you can read \u201cSea Ranch\u201d if you look close. LADY BIRD (making a joke) Cut to \u201cten years later.\u201d KYLE What? LADY BIRD Like how ten years ago you were in first grade and now we... Cut to! KYLE (quizzical) What does \u201ccut to\u201d mean to you? LADY BIRD Or like little did he know... KYLE Nothing you're saying makes sense. LADY BIRD How we\u2019re not virgins now! We deflowered each other. We have each other\u2019s flowers. She kisses him and tries to hold him but then backs off. LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) Sorry, I\u2019m just happy. KYLE I didn\u2019t lose my virginity to you. LADY BIRD Wait - what? KYLE I lost my virginity to Cassie Duval.   Excuse me? LADY BIRD   80.    LADY BIRD You said you were a virgin. KYLE No I didn\u2019t. Because I\u2019m not. And I haven\u2019t lied in two years.   Oh Jesus. LADY BIRD  KYLE Yeah, I\u2019ve probably slept with, six people? LADY BIRD You don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s six people?  KYLE I don\u2019t keep a list. LADY BIRD Why wouldn\u2019t you keep a list we\u2019re in high school? KYLE Why are you getting so moody? LADY BIRD You did say you were a virgin. KYLE I think you might have made an assumption. LADY BIRD I just had a whole experience that was wrong. She sits. Kyle opens his book up again and then closes it: KYLE You're deciding to be upset. LADY BIRD No, I am upset. KYLE Because you\u2019re deciding to be. Don't be mad at me for this. That's stupid. You can't be mad at me for something I have no control over now. LADY BIRD I just wanted it to be special. 81.    KYLE Why? You\u2019re going to have so much un-special sex in your life. LADY BIRD (fully angry now) I was on top! Who the fuck is on top their first time! KYLE Do you have any awareness about how many civilians we\u2019ve killed since invasion in Iraq started? LADY BIRD SHUT UP. SHUT UP. Different things can be sad. It\u2019s not all war.  Kyle moves away and opens a book. LADY BIRD (worried) Are we still going to prom together?  KYLE Sure. Kyle has been reading something out of the corner of his eye. INT. KITCHEN. KYLE\u2019S HOUSE. DAY. Lady Bird sneaks down the stairs, still crying, trying to get away without a conversation.

She wants to say she misses Lady Bird but instead says: MARION (CONT\u2019D) It was easier.  Lady Bird starts crying. Very hard. Marion pulls over, hugs her:  MARION (CONT\u2019D) Hey, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay.  As she\u2019s rubbing her back, Marion takes in Lady Bird\u2019s shirt, she doesn\u2019t recognize it. MARION (CONT\u2019D) What is this sweater? LADY BIRD Oh, it\u2019s just, my friend Jenna gave it to me.  MARION Who\u2019s Jenna? LADY BIRD My friend.  Marion doesn\u2019t know her daughter\u2019s friends, her t-shirts, or why she\u2019s crying. She holds Lady Bird, then thinks of something:  MARION ... want to do our favorite Sunday activity? I don\u2019t have a second shift... Lady Bird nods, it would be nice. INT./EXT. OPEN HOUSES AROUND SACRAMENTO. DAY.  Marion and Lady Bird go to all the different open houses. They love doing this. They could never buy any of them, but it is so neat to see the inside of houses you\u2019ve always known, and to imagine a different life. Where would your bed go?, etc. It\u2019s a great day. Maybe the best in a long time. Maybe ever. 83.    INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S HOUSE. DAY.  Lady Bird is back to watching television.

Larry sits across from Business Jock, just 30. BUSINESS JOCK The programmers now are, like, kids, man!  LARRY I know - but that\u2019s why I think with me you\u2019ll find something different.  BUSINESS JOCK  YEAH BUT THEY\u2019RE LIKE BABIES. LARRY I hear you, it\u2019s wild. Which is why (pointing at his resume) (MORE) 84.   LARRY (CONT'D) I got my MBA at UC Davis while still working at ISC. BUSINESS JOCK Oh, wow. That must of been a lot of work. LARRY It was. BUSINESS JOCK I heard ISC is closing now, though. LARRY I heard, yes. BUSINESS JOCK So the assholes who fired you are now closing up shop. LARRY (not feeling it) Feels good. They sit for a second. BUSINESS JOCK (looking around) Yeah... What else is supposed to happen?  LARRY Oh, I thought we were going to talk about the position.   INT. OFFICE BUILDING. WAITING ROOM. DAY.  Larry leaves his awkward interview to come get Lady Bird. She\u2019s reading a stack of old magazines. LADY BIRD How\u2019d it go? 85.    LARRY (exhausted) Let\u2019s go buy a big bag of Doritos and eat them in the car to celebrate your waitlist. LADY BIRD (laughing) Don\u2019t tell Mom! About the Doritos or the waitlist!  Then Miguel enters the waiting room. Larry and Lady Bird do a double take. Miguel looks much more conventional. Handsome, too. All his piercings are out, his tattoos covered. LARRY Oh... hi, son! LADY BIRD Wait, what are you doing here? MIGUEL I guess we\u2019re um, going for the same job then? LARRY It looks like it. Go get \u2018em! Larry and Miguel hug.   Miguel goes in to the interview. Larry watches him go, feeling how you\u2019d be feeling at that moment. Lady Bird aches for her Dad.

SISTER SARAH-JOAN I\u2019m not going to punish you. 86.    LADY BIRD Oh... why not? SISTER SARAH-JOAN (laughing) It was funny. Sister Gina and I drove all the way home before we noticed people were honking. LADY BIRD Really? SISTER SARAH-JOAN To be fair, I wasn\u2019t just married to Jesus. It\u2019s been forty years...  LADY BIRD Well he\u2019s a lucky guy. SISTER SARAH-JOAN (she considers Lady Bird) I read your college essay. You clearly love Sacramento. LADY BIRD I do?  SISTER SARAH-JOAN Well, you write about Sacramento so affectionately, and with such care. LADY BIRD I was just describing it. SISTER SARAH-JOAN It comes across as love. LADY BIRD Sure, I guess I pay attention. SISTER SARAH-JOAN Don\u2019t you think maybe they are the same thing? Love and attention? 87.    INT. THRIFT TOWN. DAY.  Marion and Lady Bird are looking for a prom dress. Lady Bird is in the dressing room trying things on. MARION (sadly) I guess you won\u2019t be going to dances in college. This is our last one. (then) You know, Davis has a terrific theatre. If you\u2019re still interested in theatre. Are you? Lady Bird comes out in a dress, it\u2019s too tight: LADY BIRD I\u2019m probably no good at acting. (looking at herself) Why don\u2019t I look like the girls in the magazines? MARION It\u2019s too bad I can\u2019t meet this Kyle before prom. LADY BIRD He\u2019s not my boyfriend anymore. I mean, maybe he never even was. MARION I\u2019d still like to meet him. LADY BIRD (O.S.) (re: the dress) IT\u2019S TOO TIGHT! FUCK. Lady Bird goes back into the dressing room. MARION I suggested you not take that second helping of pasta...  LADY BIRD MOM! 88.    MARION (innocent) Honey, you seem upset about it, I\u2019m trying to help you. LADY BIRD Mom! You\u2019re giving me an eating disorder! LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) (to herself) I wish I could get an eating disorder.  Lady Bird comes out again. The dress kind of fits her. It\u2019s bright pink and frilly. She looks happy: LADY BIRD (CONT\u2019D) I love it. Smiles up at her Mom, looking for approval: MARION (considering) Is it too pink?  Lady Bird silently goes back into the dressing room. Her Mom just crushed something that she liked and was very \u201cher.\u201d Marion picks up that she\u2019s upset: MARION (CONT\u2019D) What? LADY BIRD (O.S.) Why can\u2019t you say I look nice? MARION I thought you didn\u2019t even care what I think.  LADY BIRD (O.S.) I still want you to think I look good.  MARION I\u2019m sorry, I was telling you the truth. Do you want me to lie? LADY BIRD (O.S.) No, I just wish... I wish that you liked me. 89.    MARION Of course I love you. Lady Bird comes out.

He literally honks. LADY BIRD Um, I guess, that\u2019s my date. LARRY You aren\u2019t going to get in the car with a guy who honks, are you? LADY BIRD I think, yes, I am. Larry shrugs, accepting the situation. LARRY Let me get your picture. Mom\u2019s pissed she had to work a double. 90.    MIGUEL (peering out the window) Even you deserve better than this.

She touches all these letters her mother couldn\u2019t send. And she can never tell her that she has them. INT. ANOTHER DORM ROOM. NIGHT  Lady Bird sits in a dorm room full of college freshman. She stares at a half drunk paper cup of rum in her hand. She looks up, questioning:  LADY BIRD Hey. Do you believe in God? COLLEGE BOY No.  Why not? LADY BIRD COLLEGE BOY Because it\u2019s ridiculous. LADY BIRD (shaking her head) People will call each other by names their parents made up for them but they won\u2019t believe in God. COLLEGE BOY What\u2019s your name? LADY BIRD (considering) Christine. My name is Christine.    I\u2019m David. They shake hands.  You shake. I shake.  COLLEGE BOY  DAVID CHRISTINE DAVID Where are you from? CHRISTINE Sacramento. DAVID Sorry, where? The music was too loud, he hadn\u2019t heard her. Second try: CHRISTINE San Francisco. DAVID Cool! San Francisco is a great city.  She is immediately ashamed, but pleased with her social success. She drinks everything.  CUT TO: Lady Bird is very drunk now. She leans out the window. David does, too. She yells at the sky. LADY BIRD BRUCE! COLLEGE BOY No, my name is David. INT. LADY BIRD\u2019S DORM. NIGHT.  Back in her dorm with the David. She is so drunk that she is half way between passing out and throwing up. David is flipping through her giant CD case.    DAVID Jesus Christ you have bad music. It\u2019s all Greatest Hits. CHRISTINE But they\u2019re the Greatest, what\u2019s wrong with that?  David puts down the CD case and starts making out with her. She throws up all over him. DAVID Oh, god, oh god! He gets up and runs away, out of the room. INT. DORM ROOM. NIGHT. Christine being loaded onto some kind of strap down chair. She is crying.  CHRISTINE I\u2019m sorry.  INT. HOSPITAL. NIGHT. Christine looks up, half awake. A nurse comes into focus. NURSE What do you want us to do, she\u2019s drunk. Christine passes out again. INT. HOSPITAL. DAY. Christine opens her eyes. Looks at her bracelet. Sits up. A child sits across from her with something definitely wrong with his eye. She winces. She stands. It seems like she can just walk out. She does. EXT. NYC STREET. DAY. Christine is hung over but basically okay. Stops a man: CHRISTINE What day is it? NYC MAN Sunday.    CHRISTINE Thank you.  She walks past a church. People are filing in. So does she. INT. CHURCH. DAY. Snippets of a sermon, some donation baskets. The choir gets up to sing \u201cBlessed Assurance.\u201d  Christine listens and then cries, hard, and then starts laughing and singing along. It turns out that her life is just beginning.  She ducks into the entry-way of the church. Gets out her phone, calls her home phone. It rings and rings. She leaves a message:  CHRISTINE Hi Mom and Dad, it\u2019s me. Christine. It\u2019s the name you gave me. It\u2019s a good one. Dad, this is more for Mom - Hey Mom: did you feel emotional the first time that you drove in Sacramento? I did and I wanted to tell you, but we weren\u2019t really talking when it happened. All those bends I\u2019ve known my whole life, and stores, and the whole thing. But I wanted to tell you. I love you. Thank you, I\u2019m... thank you.  Hangs up and listens from the back of the church while the choir continues singing. Credits. ",
