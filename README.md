# data-ml-pocs
This repo showcases a multitude of different machine learning and artificial intelligence realted projects in POC (Proof-Of-Concept) stage. The goal of this repo is to demonstrate different approaches to tackle problems with ML-driven solutions. With fast advances in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs), foundation models can provide a high confidence in supporting a engine to generate context driven responses for a platform feature.

The following information displays the different POCs whereas each POC is developed as standalone application for proper testing and evaluation. 

## Projects
Each folder in this repository is representing a standalone application based on a given problem statement. For each project there is a Readme.md file in the subfolder that describes the contribution and demo steps in great detail.

### Search Attributes - SQLChain-based
This project uses a LangChian SQL chain to create a query that is being used to extract data from a postgres database.

### Search Attributes - Vector Embeddings
This project focuses on using LLM Embeddings to create vectors out of a text. These vectors are stored in a vector database, then queried by the KNN / ANN search functions.

### AWS Rekognition - Celebrity Comparsion
This repo provides a simple app to compare celebrity photos with profile photos checking a similarity between the two.
